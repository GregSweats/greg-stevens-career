### Eat Your Own Dog Food

> _"**Eating your own dog food** or “**dogfooding**” is the practice of using one's own products or services._
> 
> In 2006, the editor of _[IEEE Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_Software "IEEE Software")_ recounted that in the 1970s television advertisements for [Alpo dog food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpo_(pet_food) "Alpo (pet food)"), [Lorne Greene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorne_Greene "Lorne Greene") pointed out that he fed Alpo to his own dogs. Another possible origin he remembers is from the president of Kal Kan Pet Food, who was said to eat a can of his dog food at shareholders' meetings.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food#cite_note-ieee-4)
> 
> In 1988, [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") manager [Paul Maritz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maritz "Paul Maritz") sent [Brian Valentine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Valentine "Brian Valentine"), test manager for [Microsoft LAN Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_LAN_Manager "Microsoft LAN Manager"), an email titled "Eating our own Dogfood", challenging him to increase internal usage of the company's product. From there, the usage of the term spread through the company.

### RTFM and WTFM
- RTFM you should know, but if not, it stands for "Read the F'ing Manual"
- WTFM I just made up, "Write the F'ing Manual"
	- How can anyone read what has not been written? Psychic powers?
- RTD - Read the Docs - is more appropriate these days, but also the name of a comapny.
- Yearbook quote.
