> ## Siege
> 
> ## WHAT IS IT?
> 
> Siege is an open source regression test and benchmark utility. It can stress test a single URL with a user defined number of simulated users, or it can read many URLs into memory and stress them simultaneously. The program reports the total number of hits recorded, bytes transferred, response time, concurrency, and return status. Siege supports HTTP/1.0 and 1.1 protocols, the GET and POST directives, cookies, transaction logging, and basic authentication. Its features are configurable on a per user basis.
> 
> Most features are configurable with command line options which also include default values to minimize the complexity of the program's invocation. Siege allows you to stress a web server with n number of users t number of times, where n and t are defined by the user. It records the duration time of the test as well as the duration of each single transaction. It reports the number of transactions, elapsed time, bytes transferred, response time, transaction rate, concurrency and the number of times the server responded OK, that is status code 200.
> 
> Siege was designed and implemented by Jeffrey Fulmer in his position as Webmaster for Armstrong World Industries. It was modeled in part after Lincoln Stein's torture.pl and it's data reporting is almost identical. But torture.pl does not allow one to stress many URLs simultaneously; out of that need siege was born....

> When a HTTP server is being hit by the program, it is said to be "under siege."
