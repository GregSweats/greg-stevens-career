## Adobe ColdFusion Advanced Certification
+ Special `Advanced` Rating on Cert (> some percentage on the exam)

- ~20....25??? years old
- Took with another developer, and then CTO of the Agency.
- Only one to achieve Advanced  Cert (> 90% on exam)
(didn't realize it existed until I received it, stumbling successfully through life)
- Came in use to register my `stevens.pro` domain name.
- .pro required a degree or certification of some type, of which I had nothing official. ^mrgQmKec
