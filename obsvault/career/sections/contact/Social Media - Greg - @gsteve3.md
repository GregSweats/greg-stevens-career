	- *What do you think of the name `@DDOINC` (Dalyle DevOps INC)...DDOINC (curious what sound others make in their head, I hear a [pogo stick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz1ca1-_-MY) like sound)*
- [LinkedIn @dalyle](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dalyle)
- [GitHub @dalyle](https://github.com/dalyle)
	- My `@gsteve3` account listed below is more active.
	- `@dalyle` is currently more a placeholder/branding account.


### Personal

#### Why `@gsteve3`?
- It's all left handed!
- Otherwise it would have been `@gsteve403` for my area code.
- But, this is more ergonomic when hand is on mouse, and typing it repetitively.
- I know, I know, I should macro it with [[AutoHotKeys]].
