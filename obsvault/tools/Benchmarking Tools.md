## Load Testing

### apachebench

> **apachebench** (ab is the real program file name) is a single-threaded command line computer program used for benchmarking (measuring the performance of) HTTP web servers.  Originally it was used to test the Apache HTTP Server but it is generic enough to test any web server supporting HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1 protocol versions.
>
> The ab tool is written in C and it comes bundled with the standard Apache source distribution, and like the Apache web server itself, is free, open source software and distributed under the terms of the Apache License.
