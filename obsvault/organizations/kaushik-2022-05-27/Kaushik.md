# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! 


Hi [Kaushik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaushikudwadia/),


Set this up as a place to share some links, so easy to update.

In fact, I have [[OBS Studio]] recording this right now!

Will upload later if you are interested.


You stumbled onto someone who is either on the path to great things, or insanity, or both.

Apologies upfront for the elevated blood pressure you may experience from the [[excitement]] I bring!


Perhaps this is [kismit](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kismet)?

Best,

Greg
