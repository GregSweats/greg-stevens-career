 #### 80 WPM Avg, 128 Max

It feels weird to add a section purely about typing, but, as a stranger told me in Mexico, watching me type in the resort's computer area (no wifi at the time), I "have wonderful typing form".

Also trying to hustle to make some money, fame, and most-importantly, credibility, by finding, entering, and winning, some typing contests.


- Currently preparing to possibly enter the 2022 [Ultimate Typing Championship](https://ultimatetypingchampionship.com/)
	- May require 170 WPM average, working on it!
- Becoming keyboard enthusiast
- Won iPad at the Consumer Electronic Show (CES) in Vegas, circa 2010, for typing the fa on a Zagg(folio?) Keyboard, on an iPad, of all competitors within the ten days of CES.
