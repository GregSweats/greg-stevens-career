## What is this?

- I'm not totally sure, but it's version is v22.1; Released ~2022-05-12;
- Sat down, excited to see remote opportunities on the **West Coast**, but I am from **Alberta, Canada**, mere 1.5 hour flight, or ~1,000km away.
- One hour ahead of the Washington time zone.
	- I am so dumb, **Portland** is right near me!
	- "Dumb" in a good way though, it's how I roll throw life, only knowing I know nothing in the big scheme of things.
	- , as  I had no idea! `Portlandia` was awesome.
	- Looking for more positive word to replace goto "Dumb".
- Started as an application for [[Customer Success Manager (Remote) - webclip]].
- Turned into a **hope to chat with Mathias**, to try some COO tasks, see how we vibe, and hopefully see if I can cut it on some contract/volunteer COO work.
- I think I might be able to handle it.
- I know if I can't we will all know right away, bail, no problem.
- If it works though, man, we may hit some new heights ðŸš€ðŸ’˜
- All caused by [[Customer Success Manager (Remote) - webclip]]
	- Now I would like to be considered for a COO candidate though.
	- I am highly underqualified, but I believe experienced, agile and pragmatic enough, to adapt quickly and help this startup reach amazing heights!


Best,


Greg
