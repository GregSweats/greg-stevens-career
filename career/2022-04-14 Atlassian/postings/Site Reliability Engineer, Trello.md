# Site Reliability Engineer, Trello

SRE | New York, United States | Remote Americas | Full Time

[Apply for this job](https://jobs.lever.co/atlassian/cce06426-e281-4f22-b210-978f6887c9b5/apply)

```ad-note
- Oh...Trello job, different job board than the [Principal Full Stack Enginner](https://www.atlassian.com/company/careers/detail/e2ae5609-b943-43d6-9703-c10f228ca9af)
	- `www.atlassian.com/...` vs `jobs.lever.co/atlassian/...`
	- I like the Trello one since it sets the HTML title properly, better for SEO, easier for me to copy/paste/drag into notes.
```

**Working at Atlassian**

**Atlassian can hire people in any country where we have a legal entity. Assuming you have eligible working rights and a sufficient time zone overlap with your team, you can choose to work remotely or return to an office as they reopen (unless it’s necessary for your role to be performed in the office). Interviews and onboarding are conducted virtually, a part of being a distributed-first company.**

As a Site Reliability Engineer at Trello, you’ll work on keeping everything running efficiently as we scale our infrastructure to support our more than 90 million Trello users while maintaining our 99.99% uptime target. The code you write and deploy into production will directly contribute to the scalability and resilience of Trello, and you will directly improve our user’s experience with the product.

Key Responsibilities:

-   Comfortable owning the infrastructure and pragmatically solving problems dealing with complex systems.
-   Working with developers to support the latest features that we have in development, like Power-Ups, data pipeline improvements, and scalable microservices.
-   Contributing your insights across the team to help us improve or re-architect existing systems for scale and extensibility.
-   Contributing to new and existing compliance initiatives.

On your first day, you will have expertise in:

-   Engineering microservices and tools across one or more programming languages (e.g. Go, Python).
-   Automation and Infrastructure-as-Code projects and tooling (e.g. Ansible, Puppet, Terraform).
-   Building and maintaining a continuous integration and delivery pipeline (e.g. Bamboo, Bitbucket Pipelines, Github Actions).
-   Observability tools and methodology (e.g. logging, metrics, tracing) for highly available web services.
-   Designing and delivering AWS cloud-native infrastructure solutions.
-   Incident response and management in on-call rotation.
-   Focus on operational maturity and reliability with microservices.

It's great, but not required to have:

-   Experience building and managing large scale, high impact systems on AWS or other cloud infrastructure.
-   Experience with large MongoDB cluster deployments.
