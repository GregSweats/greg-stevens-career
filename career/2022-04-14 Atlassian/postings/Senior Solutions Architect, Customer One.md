**Working at Atlassian**

**Atlassian can hire people in any country where we have a legal entity. Assuming you have eligible working rights and a sufficient time zone overlap with your team, you can choose to work remotely or return to an office as they reopen (unless it’s necessary for your role to be performed in the office). Interviews and onboarding are conducted virtually, a part of being a distributed-first company.**

Atlassian is seeking an experienced, strategic and innovative Solution Architect to lead the expansion of the company’s use of its own products as a strategic enabler of its business goals and objectives. This individual will act as a trusted partner between Product teams and IT to deliver innovative solutions that not only delight internal customers but also improve the products we sell to our end customers.

**A bit about the team**

Customer One started as a small team of 2 with the belief that Atlassian IT will be our first, and best, customer. Since this short time ago, we have doubled down on this priority, grown the team and proven the value that can be delivered through this vision. With our small team, we have influenced Atlassian product roadmaps, guided customers through our adoption journey & best practices, and established ourselves as a valued Enterprise customer for Atlassian. We are now looking to hit the accelerator to unleash the vast potential of this program as Atlassian grows our Enterprise customer base. This is an exciting time to join the Team and help us scale what was just an idea in the recent past!

Does this sound exciting to you? You might be the person we’re looking for!

You Will:

-   Work across all domains in IT (Sales, Marketing, Finance, Support to name a few) partnering with other architects by recommending and designing solutions that involve using Atlassian products
-   Design solutions that extend Atlassian products through marketplace apps, forge plugins or via 2nd/3rd party integrations
-   Influence product roadmaps using technical feedback for feature requests and product improvements
-   Conduct POCs, to vet out new technology and ideas using a fail fast mentality
-   Redefine traditional IT by providing thought leadership on new ways to use our Atlassian products within a modern, agile, cloud-based IT environment
-   Participate in mock RFPs to evaluate Atlassian IT "purchases"
-   Grow the program within Atlassian (and externally) by advocating and amplifying our work through roadshows, town halls, blog posts, authoring reference architectures and more

About You:

-   You are well versed in architectural disciplines and have designed high performance, large and scalable enterprise systems
-   You are a passionate technologist that stays updated across industry trends, competition and innovation
-   You are a self starter with a mindset for innovation and taking calculated risks
-   You foster a culture of trust and collaboration between disparate teams to work together to achieve a common goal

On your first day, we’ll expect you to have:

-   8+ years of professional software development experience with 4+ years as a Solution Architect
-   Experience with AWS infrastructure and/or Microservices
-   Proficiency in one or more programming languages (eg Java, Python, etc)
-   Understanding of SaaS, PaaS, IaaS industry with hands-on experience with public cloud offerings (e.g., AWS, GCS, Azure)

-   Familiarity with the Atlassian product portfolio
-   Bachelor's or Master's degree in a related field (or equivalent experience) 
-   Excellent verbal and written communication skills adjusted for different audiences

It’s awesome but not required if you have:

-   Experience designing integrations between SaaS platforms and Atlassian products
-   Understanding of microservice oriented architectures and REST APIs
-   Familiarity designing user experiences
