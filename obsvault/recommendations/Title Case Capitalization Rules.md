> Tags Used in This Obsidian Vault

- Just learned `in` is a preposition, so good that it didn't uppercase that.
- Rolling with it, others tend to know more than me :) Trying to follow/trust the experts.

> ### Words Not Capitalized in Title Case
> 
> While the above words are generally capitalized in titles regardless of style, there are some words that are generally not capitalized when using title case. Again, these will depend on the specific style you choose (see [Title Capitalization Rules by Style](https://capitalizemytitle.com/#capitalizationrules) section). These include short words and conjunctions:
