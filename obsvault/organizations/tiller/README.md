## Relevant Notes

### `csv2ofx` Mapping for EQBank.ca

![[csv2ofx]]


### `Actual Budget` Finance Software Review & Recommendations (2022-05)

-  Turned into its own repo that I unsolicitedly shared with the app's author.

https://github.com/gsteve3/actualbudget-notes-obsidian

### ~8 Months of Personal & Small Business Financial Tool Trials
- Budgeting, FinTech, etc..
- Personal and Small Business
	- I used tools for either sector for both to see how they would handle various cases.
- 

### PowerBI Package for Moodle Data Source (`Savvy Student Stats, SSS`)

- I wanted more data on my son's COVID/at-home years, Grade 7 and 8.
- After about a month, I wound up creating a PowerBI package that uses the built-in/core Moodle Web Services REST API to get data.
- Amazing how much data is available!
- Have ideas for using this to help motivate households, probably with a monetery value attached to a score that is determined by some [[Machine Learning]] and ranks grades, goals, and determines a single, weighted number that can be used by children to compare their scores.
- As [Greg Glassman](https://www.google.ca/search?q=greg+glassman) said with CrossFit, people will kill each other for points, hence CrossFit's timing and scoring of everything.
