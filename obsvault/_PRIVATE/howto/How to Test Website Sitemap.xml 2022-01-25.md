# How to Test Website Sitemap.xml 2022-01-25


- Testing Ultramar Commercial
- [[Stephane Gagne from Reptile]] reported issue with Sitemap.
- [[C5 Automated Jobs]] had not triggered yet, which meant sitemap.xml, which is left out of git because it is dynamically generated by the CMS, did not exist #error404 .
- [[C5 Automated Jobs]] were run manually, by opening the job URL from the C5 login page in my browser ([[Greg Stevens @gsteve3]]).



## Verification #1: `/sitemap.xml` Exists (Check in Browser)

- Any site will usually have a sitemap at `/sitemap.xml`
- If not, `/sitemap.xml` should point to where the proper XML files are using `<sitemapindex>`.
	- Sometimes there can be multiples, one for the site content, one for locations, one for other parts of the system. (just an example of general website Sitemap.xml info)
	- https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/sitemaps/large-sitemaps


### Test Steps

1. [x] **Open the Sitemap Link**
	1. [x] https://commercial.ultramar.ca/sitemap.xml
2. [x] **XML Content should display**  *(or just a big list of links)*
	1. [x] #screenshot ![[20220125104828-screenshot-sitemap-xml-ultramarcomm.png]]
3. [ ] Roughly Check Page URLs
	1. [ ] Anything missing?
	2. [ ] Anything extra?
	3. [ ] Anything out of place?
