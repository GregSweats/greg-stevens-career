You are a self-starter and excel at making your own decisions and organizing your work according to the declared goals.

**What you'll do**

We're looking for Back End Web Engineers to work with our partner, Epic Games, to build their game websites and store. And yes! They’re the publisher of the popular game Fortnite.

> - Can even discuss pros/cons of Node on Windows, Linux, WSL, VMs, etc..
> - Used in almost every DevOps Pipeline I've setup, except for some legacy projects and those which we experimented with adding the output of `npm run prod` to the site source code, to avoid having node run anywhere, save the CPU cycles. 
> - It sort of works but the code base can get large.
>
> - **Can we please discuss what you do and what I do, then make something awesomer?!?!**
> - Then share it for free with the world as an open source best practice guide?
