In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), **transclusion** is the inclusion of part or all of an [electronic document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_document "Electronic document") into one or more other documents by [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext "Hypertext") [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_(computer_science) "Reference (computer science)"). Transclusion is usually performed when the referencing document is displayed, and is normally automatic and transparent to the end user.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion#cite_note-1) The result of transclusion is a single integrated document made of parts assembled dynamically from separate sources, possibly stored on different computers in disparate places.
