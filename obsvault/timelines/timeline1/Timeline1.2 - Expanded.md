**Technical Support**
<br >
*(3 years)*
<br>
- During my employment, Nucleus was a top-notch, local Internet Service Provider (ISP), specializing in Business and Home ADSL Service.
- Offered one of the only legitimate alternativers to the "big" providers such as [Shaw](https://www.shaw.ca/?utm_campaign=career.stevens.pro&utm_medium=obsidian&utm_source=Timeline1), [TELUS](https://www.telus.com/?utm_campaign=career.stevens.pro&utm_medium=obsidian&utm_source=Timeline1), and more.
- Unbeknowing to Nucleus, years earlier, as a teenager, I may have ~~hacked~~ security tested their network, obtained a remote x session, and ran a speed test, for a consistent 5 Mbps up and down! üöÄ Then, hypothetically, sent an email from a ~~hacked~~ vulnerable TELUS account for anonymity, about the vulnerability.
