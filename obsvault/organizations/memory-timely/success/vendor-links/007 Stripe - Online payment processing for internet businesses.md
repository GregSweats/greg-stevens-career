We agonize over the right abstractions so your teams don’t need to stitch together disparate systems or spend months integrating payments functionality.

We offer client and server libraries in everything from React and PHP to .NET and iOS.

Use integrations for systems like Shopify, WooCommerce, NetSuite, and more.

From [direct integrations](https://stripe.com/en-ca/newsroom/news/direct-platform) with card networks and banks to checkout flows in the browser, we operate on and optimize at every level of the financial stack.

We release [hundreds of features](https://stripe.com/en-ca/payments/features) and improvements each year to help you stay ahead of industry shifts. (On average, we deploy our production API 16x per day.)

Our systems operate with [99.99%+](https://status.stripe.com/) uptime and are highly scalable and redundant. Stripe is certified to the highest compliance standards.

Our machine learning models train on [billions](https://stripe.com/en-ca/radar) of data points and help increase revenue across conversion, fraud, revenue recovery, and more.

For ambitious companies around the world, Stripe makes moving money as simple, borderless, and programmable as the rest of the internet. Our teams are based in dozens of offices around the world and we process hundreds of billions of dollars each year for [startups to large enterprises](https://stripe.com/en-ca/customers).
