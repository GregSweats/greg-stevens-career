Program state and mutable objects are usually modeled with temporal logic , as explicit variables that represent the program state at each step of a program execution: a variable state is passed as an input parameter of a state-transforming function, which returns the updated state as part of its return value. This style handles state changes without losing the referential transparency of the program expressions. Purely functional programming consists of ensuring that functions, inside the functional paradigm, will only depend on their arguments, regardless of any global or local state. A pure functional subroutine only has visibility of changes of state represented by state variables included in its scope. --- \u00b6 Lookout Engineering Reviews - Glassdoor \u00b6 URL: https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Lookout-Engineering-Reviews-EI_IE318794.0,7_KO8,19.htm The company is San Francisco based so there is a bit of disconnect in Toronto office. It's not a public company yet. --- \u00b6 Lookout Engineering Reviews - Glassdoor \u00b6 URL: https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Lookout-Engineering-Reviews-EI_IE318794.0,7_KO8,19.htm Pros - My direct management is great to work with. Weekly 1:1s means nothing has time to go seriously wrong, and you always get a chance at addressing issues fast. Suggestions are honestly considered and acted on - Office perks are great. Working from home is not frowned upon, and allows for good life-work balance - As the company is a start-up trying to evolve into an enterprise, there's a lot of disorganization flying around, which means opportunities really. If you are a business-savvy and experienced engineer, you can make sense of the messy parts and be part of the solution - A lot of the grief people have about working at lookout comes from the way ops are done at the company. As part of the team responsible for correcting this, finding a purpose in your work is easy. - My recruitment process was very fast, respectful of my time and surprisingly pleasant. Instead of doing a computer-led coding assignment, I got to have a live coding session with my future team lead, and had the opportunity to get to know him better, his coding philosophy, and explain the rationale behind the code I was writing. Also, this being a live coding interview, you feel comforted by the fact that you won't go astray, or be grossly missing the automated unit testing's logic at the end of the assignment - In my team, employee growth is valued by management. No idea how it goes in other teams - The product is exciting, socially valuable and in a high-growth niche Cons - Some people build up resentment and sway around negativity - The company, being a start-up, sometimes has trouble getting itself together and focusing on value-generating activities. This can be disorienting and sometimes disheartening - I would not recommend junior or school-fresh engineers to start their careers at Lookout, as it currently is not providing the kind of structure and organizational best practices you'd hope to acquire being green in this industry - Lack of documentation about company-specific implementations can be confusing - The company's tried to steer the ship many times in the past, and that can be seen through an incoherent tech stack with way too many patterns and frameworks being used. In a way, it is symptomatic of a start-up not yet being able to transition from \"small team of talented engineers who do something really good\" to a well-oiled machine - Lack of leadership by parts of management AND technical positions. - People generally lack non-technical skills that are necessary even in a tech-focused business - You have flexibility of working hours, which can lead to you not being ever totally \"off\" unless you discipline yourself Advice to Management If your middle management is not demonstrating leadership and can't achieve your vision, it's time to think either train middle management in business skills, or reshuffle positions so that your management can act on your business vision --- \u00b6 Lookout Engineering Reviews - Glassdoor \u00b6 URL: https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Lookout-Engineering-Reviews-EI_IE318794.0,7_KO8,19.htm Pros During my time in this company I have learned and met good people. It has been an interesting ride. Cons * death marches * middle managers that have turned the gaslighting of their employees into a competitive sport * teams that treat other teams like their enemy * teams that actively sabotage other teams * new good people sidelined in favor of old employees who have the ear of management * focus on security theater while great security researchers are stuck in molasses trying to do their freaking job!! * a perverse fixation on doubling down and adding to technical debt * engineering practices and culture is a mighty trash fire on which engineering management and \"senior\" architects sacrifice the sanity and happiness of new engineers (attrition on some teams is 50%+!!!) * executive management that talks about cutting costs \"saving every pencil\" while the company burns money constantly recreating existing software projects and redoing work of other teams Advice to Management If you care about this company and the its future you need to understand that you are in the business of building software! You have been doing the \"new path\" for 3 years but you are not anywhere in terms of building a product. While your c-level is saving pencils the new middle management is running the ship. Running it right into the bottom of the ocean. They are ruining the engineering organization. Fire your engineering management and \"senior\" architects. Fire your old pre-2015 product team.. Roll up your sleeves and start building software again!! Stop lying to yourselves that everything is ok. --- \u00b6 What\u2019s New in TeamCity \u00b6 URL: https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/whatsnew/ TeamCity 2022.04 introduces the new Parallel Testing feature that delivers an extraordinary speed boost when testing your projects.

Tableau needs a much bigger server than Metabase to run well. It\u2019s difficult to do much for less than \u00a32000 per year in licensing. PowerBI looks great at first (\u00a38 per user per month), but once you start to do anything clever it very quickly switches to the hosted model at \u00a3XXXX per month plus user licences. Ignore the free licence unless you\u2019re one person working on their own. I don\u2019t do much with Tableau, but I have done a lttle with PowerBI. PowerBI is prettier at the moment and does a very nice job of working with multiple data sources. The data exploration is weak compared to Metabase, though you do get proper drilldown and can select by clicking charts rather than having to use parameters. PowerBI\u2019s greatest weakness is when it comes to sharing your work - you export to PowerPoint to view a picture of your work. Metabase\u2019s option of sharing links is far more powerful.","title":"Monday, June 13, 2022"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-13/#monday-june-13-2022","text":"","title":"Monday, June 13, 2022"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-13/#2022-06-12-2022-06-14","text":"","title":"&lt;&lt; [[2022-06-12]] - 2022-06-14 &gt;&gt;"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-13/#senior-devops-engineer-jobs-in-calgary-ab-glassdoor","text":"URL: https://www.glassdoor.ca/Job/calgary-senior-devops-engineer-jobs-SRCH_IL.0,7_IC2275123_KO8,30.htm","title":"Senior devops engineer Jobs in Calgary, AB - Glassdoor"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-13/#-","text":"","title":"---"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-13/#purely-functional-programming-wikipedia","text":"URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming","title":"Purely functional programming - Wikipedia"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-13/#-_1","text":"","title":"---"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-13/#purely-functional-programming-wikipedia_1","text":"URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming In computer science , purely functional programming usually designates a programming paradigm \u2014a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs\u2014that treats all computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions . Program state and mutable objects are usually modeled with temporal logic , as explicit variables that represent the program state at each step of a program execution: a variable state is passed as an input parameter of a state-transforming function, which returns the updated state as part of its return value. This style handles state changes without losing the referential transparency of the program expressions. Purely functional programming consists of ensuring that functions, inside the functional paradigm, will only depend on their arguments, regardless of any global or local state.

Working from home is not frowned upon, and allows for good life-work balance - As the company is a start-up trying to evolve into an enterprise, there's a lot of disorganization flying around, which means opportunities really. If you are a business-savvy and experienced engineer, you can make sense of the messy parts and be part of the solution - A lot of the grief people have about working at lookout comes from the way ops are done at the company. As part of the team responsible for correcting this, finding a purpose in your work is easy. - My recruitment process was very fast, respectful of my time and surprisingly pleasant. Instead of doing a computer-led coding assignment, I got to have a live coding session with my future team lead, and had the opportunity to get to know him better, his coding philosophy, and explain the rationale behind the code I was writing. Also, this being a live coding interview, you feel comforted by the fact that you won't go astray, or be grossly missing the automated unit testing's logic at the end of the assignment - In my team, employee growth is valued by management. No idea how it goes in other teams - The product is exciting, socially valuable and in a high-growth niche Cons - Some people build up resentment and sway around negativity - The company, being a start-up, sometimes has trouble getting itself together and focusing on value-generating activities. This can be disorienting and sometimes disheartening - I would not recommend junior or school-fresh engineers to start their careers at Lookout, as it currently is not providing the kind of structure and organizational best practices you'd hope to acquire being green in this industry - Lack of documentation about company-specific implementations can be confusing - The company's tried to steer the ship many times in the past, and that can be seen through an incoherent tech stack with way too many patterns and frameworks being used. In a way, it is symptomatic of a start-up not yet being able to transition from \"small team of talented engineers who do something really good\" to a well-oiled machine - Lack of leadership by parts of management AND technical positions. - People generally lack non-technical skills that are necessary even in a tech-focused business - You have flexibility of working hours, which can lead to you not being ever totally \"off\" unless you discipline yourself Advice to Management If your middle management is not demonstrating leadership and can't achieve your vision, it's time to think either train middle management in business skills, or reshuffle positions so that your management can act on your business vision","title":"Lookout Engineering Reviews - Glassdoor"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-13/#-_4","text":"","title":"---"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-13/#lookout-engineering-reviews-glassdoor_2","text":"URL: https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Lookout-Engineering-Reviews-EI_IE318794.0,7_KO8,19.htm Pros During my time in this company I have learned and met good people.

Cons * death marches * middle managers that have turned the gaslighting of their employees into a competitive sport * teams that treat other teams like their enemy * teams that actively sabotage other teams * new good people sidelined in favor of old employees who have the ear of management * focus on security theater while great security researchers are stuck in molasses trying to do their freaking job!! * a perverse fixation on doubling down and adding to technical debt * engineering practices and culture is a mighty trash fire on which engineering management and \"senior\" architects sacrifice the sanity and happiness of new engineers (attrition on some teams is 50%+!!!) * executive management that talks about cutting costs \"saving every pencil\" while the company burns money constantly recreating existing software projects and redoing work of other teams Advice to Management If you care about this company and the its future you need to understand that you are in the business of building software! You have been doing the \"new path\" for 3 years but you are not anywhere in terms of building a product. While your c-level is saving pencils the new middle management is running the ship. Running it right into the bottom of the ocean. They are ruining the engineering organization. Fire your engineering management and \"senior\" architects. Fire your old pre-2015 product team.. Roll up your sleeves and start building software again!!

Julia understands two kinds of environments: A project environment is a directory with a project file and an optional manifest file, and forms an explicit environment . The project file determines what the names and identities of the direct dependencies of a project are. The manifest file, if present, gives a complete dependency graph, including all direct and indirect dependencies, exact versions of each dependency, and sufficient information to locate and load the correct version. A package directory is a directory containing the source trees of a set of packages as subdirectories, and forms an implicit environment . If X is a subdirectory of a package directory and X/src/X.jl exists, then the package X is available in the package directory environment and X/src/X.jl is the source file by which it is loaded. These can be intermixed to create a stacked environment : an ordered set of project environments and package directories, overlaid to make a single composite environment. The precedence and visibility rules then combine to determine which packages are available and where they get loaded from. Julia's load path forms a stacked environment, for example. These environment each serve a different purpose: --- \u00b6 React Fabric \u00b6 URL: https://react-fabric.github.io/#/ react-fabric implements the Office UI Fabric components natively in React.

Script lab is a tool for anyone who wants to learn about writing Office Add-ins for Excel, Outlook, Word, or PowerPoint. The focus is the Office JavaScript API, which is the technology you need for building Office Add-ins that run across platforms. Maybe you're an experienced Office developer and you want to quickly prototype a feature for your add-in. Or maybe you've never tried writing code for Office and you just want to play with a sample and tweak it to learn more. Either way, Script Lab is for you. Script Lab has three main features: Code in a pane beside your spreadsheet. IntelliSense is there while you type so you can easily discover and use the Office JavaScript objects and methods. And if you don't want to start from scratch there are plenty of samples pre-installed with Script Lab. Your snippets can use any TypeScript features like arrow functions, template strings, and async/await (i.e., a good chunk of ES6 and ES7 features). But it's not only script: your snippets can also use HTML, CSS, and references to external libraries and data on the web. Script Lab uses the Monaco editor, the same tech that powers VS Code, so it's beautiful and lightweight. Run the code in another pane beside the editor. Execution can include logic, API calls to Office, UI in the pane, and even output to a console. Every time you make a code change you can refresh the editor and run the new version in seconds. Share your snippets through GitHub. If you create a snippet you'd like to share, you can use Script Lab to save it. Then send the link to someone else to try it and tweak it on their computer. The Import feature lets you load other people's snippets. Script Lab works in Office 2013 or later on Windows, Office on the web, or Office on Mac. You can get Script Lab right now for free from Microsoft AppSource! It works for Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. If you're interested in developing for Outlook, you can get Script Lab for Outlook , also free from AppSource. Script Lab is a Microsoft Garage project that began at a hackathon. You can read the story of the original Script Lab creation on the Garage website .

TL;DR: Semverbot automates semver versioning for your git projects. Go check it out! https://github.com/restechnica/semverbot I have automated release processes for many of my clients in the past and got tired of reinventing automated semver versioning over and over again, so I decided to write a cross-platform tool for it. I couldn't find any alternative which is built for pipeline usage. Let me know what you think! Hopeful that this tool will grow and be useful to others. There are definitely improvement points, we're only at version 0.2.0 at the time of posting. Some facts about Semverbot: it is built on top of Git supports Windows, Linux, macOS it makes use of different modes and criteria to decide which semver level to increment it has an 'auto' mode by default, which makes it really easy to get started it supports a configuration file it is available from GitHub and a Homebrew tap https://github.com/restechnica/homebrew-tap works well for both pipeline and developer Projects already using Semverbot: https://github.com/restechnica/semverbot (Yes, it releases itself!) https://github.com/restechnica/terrathon (python pip package) https://github.com/restechnica/cliwrap-python (python pip package) --- \u00b6 Follow SemVer \u00b7 Issue #2888 \u00b7 jashkenas/backbone \u00b6 URL: https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/2888 Thanks, but strictly following \"semantic\" versioning wouldn't work out very well for Backbone. Given that the project is almost all surface area, and very little internals, almost any given change (patch, pull request) to Backbone breaks backwards-compatibility in some small way ... even if only for the folks relying on previously undefined behavior. If we strictly followed \"semantic\" versioning, it would probably be Backbone.js 43.0.0 by now \u2014 which doesn't help anyone evaluate the actual progress of the project. So, as I like to joke \u2014 not \"semantic\" versioning, romantic versioning . Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the: MAJOR version when you make a major new release, or significantly update and/or stabilize the API. MINOR version when you add minor new features. PATCH version when you make tiny changes, likely to go unnoticed by most. This allows folks, immediately upon hearing about a new release, to get a rough sense of its scope. As to backwards compatibility \u2014 ideally every release, even major ones, are backwards-compatible. And when they can't be, because an API is changing, it should be done in a way that isn't too difficult to upgrade. But avoiding any change to the API, and waiting for a \"MAJOR\" release to be ready would be a terrific impediment to progress. And the alternative of frequently incrementing the MAJOR version number is incredibly unhelpful. Honestly, I'd prefer a simpler scheme that just used BIG.SMALL version numbers \u2014 like most desktop applications do ... but I'd worry about it breaking package managers and other tooling. --- \u00b6 Follow SemVer \u00b7 Issue #2888 \u00b7 jashkenas/backbone \u00b6 URL: https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/2888 +1 for spadgos@ question. Version numbers are arbitrary. For some reason, we have agile web apps trying to keep within the same ranges as OSes. Many apps freak out about going past 10...but most of the projects you're modeling off of (Windows, Linux, etc) have 1 year/multi-year dev cycles before release, so 1.x -> 2.x is a big deal. An agile project moves very quickly, incrementing quickly makes sense too. --- \u00b6 Tab to Window/Popup - Keyboard Shortcut - Microsoft Edge Addons \u00b6 URL: https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tab-to-windowpopup-key/bfihdbkamfkhbibbcelmgclbfccfobbb --- \u00b6 Release Calver - Conventional Tools \u00b6 URL: https://conventional-tools.practically.io/release-calver/ Release Calver \u00b6 The release Calver command is a way of managing project releases with calender visioning.

Besu is different from a lot of the Hyperledger project in that it is beholden to a standard (Ethereum Mainnet compatibility) that it does not control. While it participates in co-ordination of that standard Besu does not have simple control over it like the other DLT projects do. When working with public networks such as Mainnet there is a critical need to use the most current version of Besu, no matter what the semantic compatibility is. Not dealing with a breaking change is the same as dropping the service. Mainnet is fairly good about maintaining backwards compatibility, but there are other smaller changes such as P2P network protocol upgrades and RPC APIs that update at an infrequent cadence. Besu feels that a CalVer versioning for the main DLT release itself would better signal how aligned we are to the continually moving target of mainnet compatibility. We think it will also more clearly communicate multiple release streams should not be expected. --- \u00b6 Installing PowerShellGet for Searching OWA Mailbox from CLI or URL - 2022-06-14 \u00b6 [SOLVED] Exchange Online Powershell module not installing \u00b6 URL: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2285591-exchange-online-powershell-module-not-installing https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/ hybrid -> PowerShell install it --- \u00b6 [SOLVED] Exchange Online Powershell module not installing \u00b6 URL: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2285591-exchange-online-powershell-module-not-installing You need to install the module first, Try the following: Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement Regards, Milad --- \u00b6 Simplify the Outlook Web App URL: Exchange 2013 Help | Microsoft Docs \u00b6 URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/simplify-the-outlook-web-app-url-exchange-2013-help Article 02/16/2022 3 minutes to read Applies to: Exchange Server 2013 Summary: Use the procedures in this article to simplify the URL that your organization users to access OWA in Exchange 2013. You can simplify the Microsoft Outlook Web App URL that users use to access their Exchange Server 2013 mailbox. To simplify access to Outlook Web App for your users, you may want to configure the Outlook Web App Web page, which is usually the default website in IIS, to automatically redirect users to https. The procedure in the \"Use IIS Manager to simplify the Outlook Web App URL and force redirection to SSL\" section redirects a request for http:// server to https:// server /owa. To help secure the information that's sent between the client and the server, the default Web site is set to require Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) at installation. When you configure redirection from a top-level directory in Windows Server 2008, the settings are propagated to lower-level directories. For example, when you configure redirection on the default website to the /owa virtual directory, the settings that you configure also appear on the HTTP Redirect page of all the virtual directories, such as /Autodiscover, /Exchange, and /Public. Therefore, you must remove redirection from all the virtual directories except the one that you want redirected. --- \u00b6 outlook web access - Office365 Query Strings and URL Parameters - Web Applications Stack Exchange \u00b6 URL: https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/95250/office365-query-strings-and-url-parameters/96126#96126?newreg=59ce17c112bd4ca2b031de3964f96f00 How to compose a New Message or Event and Populate fields in Office365 \u00b6 There is support available to programmatically invoke OWA mail and calendar event compose form.

The project file determines what the names and identities of the direct dependencies of a project are. The manifest file, if present, gives a complete dependency graph, including all direct and indirect dependencies, exact versions of each dependency, and sufficient information to locate and load the correct version. A package directory is a directory containing the source trees of a set of packages as subdirectories, and forms an implicit environment . If X is a subdirectory of a package directory and X/src/X.jl exists, then the package X is available in the package directory environment and X/src/X.jl is the source file by which it is loaded. These can be intermixed to create a stacked environment : an ordered set of project environments and package directories, overlaid to make a single composite environment. The precedence and visibility rules then combine to determine which packages are available and where they get loaded from. Julia's load path forms a stacked environment, for example. These environment each serve a different purpose:","title":"Environments"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-14/#-_7","text":"","title":"---"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-14/#react-fabric","text":"URL: https://react-fabric.github.io/#/ react-fabric implements the Office UI Fabric components natively in React.

Script lab is a tool for anyone who wants to learn about writing Office Add-ins for Excel, Outlook, Word, or PowerPoint. The focus is the Office JavaScript API, which is the technology you need for building Office Add-ins that run across platforms. Maybe you're an experienced Office developer and you want to quickly prototype a feature for your add-in. Or maybe you've never tried writing code for Office and you just want to play with a sample and tweak it to learn more. Either way, Script Lab is for you. Script Lab has three main features: Code in a pane beside your spreadsheet. IntelliSense is there while you type so you can easily discover and use the Office JavaScript objects and methods. And if you don't want to start from scratch there are plenty of samples pre-installed with Script Lab. Your snippets can use any TypeScript features like arrow functions, template strings, and async/await (i.e., a good chunk of ES6 and ES7 features). But it's not only script: your snippets can also use HTML, CSS, and references to external libraries and data on the web. Script Lab uses the Monaco editor, the same tech that powers VS Code, so it's beautiful and lightweight. Run the code in another pane beside the editor. Execution can include logic, API calls to Office, UI in the pane, and even output to a console. Every time you make a code change you can refresh the editor and run the new version in seconds. Share your snippets through GitHub. If you create a snippet you'd like to share, you can use Script Lab to save it. Then send the link to someone else to try it and tweak it on their computer. The Import feature lets you load other people's snippets. Script Lab works in Office 2013 or later on Windows, Office on the web, or Office on Mac. You can get Script Lab right now for free from Microsoft AppSource! It works for Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. If you're interested in developing for Outlook, you can get Script Lab for Outlook , also free from AppSource. Script Lab is a Microsoft Garage project that began at a hackathon. You can read the story of the original Script Lab creation on the Garage website .

TL;DR: Semverbot automates semver versioning for your git projects. Go check it out! https://github.com/restechnica/semverbot I have automated release processes for many of my clients in the past and got tired of reinventing automated semver versioning over and over again, so I decided to write a cross-platform tool for it. I couldn't find any alternative which is built for pipeline usage. Let me know what you think! Hopeful that this tool will grow and be useful to others. There are definitely improvement points, we're only at version 0.2.0 at the time of posting. Some facts about Semverbot: it is built on top of Git supports Windows, Linux, macOS it makes use of different modes and criteria to decide which semver level to increment it has an 'auto' mode by default, which makes it really easy to get started it supports a configuration file it is available from GitHub and a Homebrew tap https://github.com/restechnica/homebrew-tap works well for both pipeline and developer Projects already using Semverbot: https://github.com/restechnica/semverbot (Yes, it releases itself!) https://github.com/restechnica/terrathon (python pip package) https://github.com/restechnica/cliwrap-python (python pip package)","title":"(3) Meet Semverbot, a semver versioning CLI tool written in GoLang : golang"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-14/#-_14","text":"","title":"---"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-14/#follow-semver-issue-2888-jashkenasbackbone","text":"URL: https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/2888 Thanks, but strictly following \"semantic\" versioning wouldn't work out very well for Backbone. Given that the project is almost all surface area, and very little internals, almost any given change (patch, pull request) to Backbone breaks backwards-compatibility in some small way ... even if only for the folks relying on previously undefined behavior. If we strictly followed \"semantic\" versioning, it would probably be Backbone.js 43.0.0 by now \u2014 which doesn't help anyone evaluate the actual progress of the project. So, as I like to joke \u2014 not \"semantic\" versioning, romantic versioning . Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the: MAJOR version when you make a major new release, or significantly update and/or stabilize the API. MINOR version when you add minor new features. PATCH version when you make tiny changes, likely to go unnoticed by most. This allows folks, immediately upon hearing about a new release, to get a rough sense of its scope. As to backwards compatibility \u2014 ideally every release, even major ones, are backwards-compatible. And when they can't be, because an API is changing, it should be done in a way that isn't too difficult to upgrade. But avoiding any change to the API, and waiting for a \"MAJOR\" release to be ready would be a terrific impediment to progress. And the alternative of frequently incrementing the MAJOR version number is incredibly unhelpful. Honestly, I'd prefer a simpler scheme that just used BIG.SMALL version numbers \u2014 like most desktop applications do ... but I'd worry about it breaking package managers and other tooling.","title":"Follow SemVer \u00b7 Issue #2888 \u00b7 jashkenas/backbone"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-14/#-_15","text":"","title":"---"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-14/#follow-semver-issue-2888-jashkenasbackbone_1","text":"URL: https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/2888 +1 for spadgos@ question.

While it participates in co-ordination of that standard Besu does not have simple control over it like the other DLT projects do. When working with public networks such as Mainnet there is a critical need to use the most current version of Besu, no matter what the semantic compatibility is. Not dealing with a breaking change is the same as dropping the service. Mainnet is fairly good about maintaining backwards compatibility, but there are other smaller changes such as P2P network protocol upgrades and RPC APIs that update at an infrequent cadence. Besu feels that a CalVer versioning for the main DLT release itself would better signal how aligned we are to the continually moving target of mainnet compatibility. We think it will also more clearly communicate multiple release streams should not be expected.","title":"Overview of Proposal"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-14/#-_24","text":"","title":"---"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-14/#installing-powershellget-for-searching-owa-mailbox-from-cli-or-url-2022-06-14","text":"","title":"Installing PowerShellGet for Searching OWA Mailbox from CLI or URL - 2022-06-14"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-14/#solved-exchange-online-powershell-module-not-installing","text":"URL: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2285591-exchange-online-powershell-module-not-installing https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/ hybrid -> PowerShell install it","title":"[SOLVED] Exchange Online Powershell module not installing"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-14/#-_25","text":"","title":"---"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-14/#solved-exchange-online-powershell-module-not-installing_1","text":"URL: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2285591-exchange-online-powershell-module-not-installing You need to install the module first, Try the following: Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement Regards, Milad","title":"[SOLVED] Exchange Online Powershell module not installing"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-14/#-_26","text":"","title":"---"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-14/#simplify-the-outlook-web-app-url-exchange-2013-help-microsoft-docs","text":"URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/simplify-the-outlook-web-app-url-exchange-2013-help Article 02/16/2022 3 minutes to read Applies to: Exchange Server 2013 Summary: Use the procedures in this article to simplify the URL that your organization users to access OWA in Exchange 2013. You can simplify the Microsoft Outlook Web App URL that users use to access their Exchange Server 2013 mailbox. To simplify access to Outlook Web App for your users, you may want to configure the Outlook Web App Web page, which is usually the default website in IIS, to automatically redirect users to https. The procedure in the \"Use IIS Manager to simplify the Outlook Web App URL and force redirection to SSL\" section redirects a request for http:// server to https:// server /owa. To help secure the information that's sent between the client and the server, the default Web site is set to require Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) at installation. When you configure redirection from a top-level directory in Windows Server 2008, the settings are propagated to lower-level directories. For example, when you configure redirection on the default website to the /owa virtual directory, the settings that you configure also appear on the HTTP Redirect page of all the virtual directories, such as /Autodiscover, /Exchange, and /Public. Therefore, you must remove redirection from all the virtual directories except the one that you want redirected.","title":"Simplify the Outlook Web App URL: Exchange 2013 Help | Microsoft Docs"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-14/#-_27","text":"","title":"---"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-14/#outlook-web-access-office365-query-strings-and-url-parameters-web-applications-stack-exchange","text":"URL: https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/95250/office365-query-strings-and-url-parameters/96126#96126?newreg=59ce17c112bd4ca2b031de3964f96f00","title":"outlook web access - Office365 Query Strings and URL Parameters - Web Applications Stack Exchange"},{"location":"blog/2022-06-14/#how-to-compose-a-new-message-or-event-and-populate-fields-in-office365","text":"There is support available to programmatically invoke OWA mail and calendar event compose form.

Basically, I'm a Markdown Hipster, I was in it before it was cool. Working on a term... \"Holistic Website/Web App Dev & Hosting\" Would say \"Holistic Web DevOps\" or \"Holistic WebDevOps\"? What do you think? Covers all aspects of a Website/Web App Lifecycle, many of which are ignored or not known about at many Calgary and Canadian wide agencies. I've been researching for several years, while in my role as IT Director at a boutique, full-service Web Agency in Calgary, working mainly with Public Sector Oil & Gas Companies for the past 17 years. Life Purpose as of ~July 2021 \"Make the Web Industry Better!\" For clients, workers, site visitors, app users, etc. Do this by embracing the DevOps philosphy/mindset, and being Agile, a pre-req in my mind for DevOps, one I'm AMAZED is not even understood in Orgs claiming to be agile. I made a presentation, registered domains, and started raising interest amongst my surprisingly vast network of contacts. I was a MeetUp junkie.

Many FS Devs from SAIT's fast-track course. I met the administrator of the course and have been able to connect with new talent out of it. SAIT trains them on the basics of: git, GitHub, npm, and React (rather than Vue). Would like to be able to influence the program a bit, hopefully with/through partnerships with Amazon and SAIT/all Educational institutes (High Schools too!).

Basically, I'm a Markdown Hipster, I was in it before it was cool. Working on a term... \"Holistic Website/Web App Dev & Hosting\" Would say \"Holistic Web DevOps\" or \"Holistic WebDevOps\"? What do you think? Covers all aspects of a Website/Web App Lifecycle, many of which are ignored or not known about at many Calgary and Canadian wide agencies. I've been researching for several years, while in my role as IT Director at a boutique, full-service Web Agency in Calgary, working mainly with Public Sector Oil & Gas Companies for the past 17 years. Life Purpose as of ~July 2021 \"Make the Web Industry Better!\" For clients, workers, site visitors, app users, etc. Do this by embracing the DevOps philosphy/mindset, and being Agile, a pre-req in my mind for DevOps, one I'm AMAZED is not even understood in Orgs claiming to be agile. I made a presentation, registered domains, and started raising interest amongst my surprisingly vast network of contacts. I was a MeetUp junkie. CAMUG, ATB Events, Benevity, Solium (now ???), Agile, Developer, Testing, Entrepreneur, Startup, Funding, Speed Dating, Hosted table at HackerX Interviews Speed Dating style Interviews WomanHack event Lot of fresh-out-of-school Data Scientists & Full-Stack Developers. Many FS Devs from SAIT's fast-track course. I met the administrator of the course and have been able to connect with new talent out of it. SAIT trains them on the basics of: git, GitHub, npm, and React (rather than Vue). Would like to be able to influence the program a bit, hopefully with/through partnerships with Amazon and SAIT/all Educational institutes (High Schools too!). I have a soon-to-be published Open Source package for connecting Microsoft Power BI to a Student's Moodle site, using Moodle's built-in Mobile Rest API, and an auth token from the Moodle Account Settings page.

I've been researching for several years, while in my role as IT Director at a boutique, full-service Web Agency in Calgary, working mainly with Public Sector Oil & Gas Companies for the past 17 years. Life Purpose as of ~July 2021 \"Make the Web Industry Better!\" For clients, workers, site visitors, app users, etc. Do this by embracing the DevOps philosphy/mindset, and being Agile, a pre-req in my mind for DevOps, one I'm AMAZED is not even understood in Orgs claiming to be agile. I made a presentation, registered domains, and started raising interest amongst my surprisingly vast network of contacts. I was a MeetUp junkie. CAMUG, ATB Events, Benevity, Solium (now ???), Agile, Developer, Testing, Entrepreneur, Startup, Funding, Speed Dating, Hosted table at HackerX Interviews Speed Dating style Interviews WomanHack event Lot of fresh-out-of-school Data Scientists & Full-Stack Developers. Many FS Devs from SAIT's fast-track course. I met the administrator of the course and have been able to connect with new talent out of it. SAIT trains them on the basics of: git, GitHub, npm, and React (rather than Vue). Would like to be able to influence the program a bit, hopefully with/through partnerships with Amazon and SAIT/all Educational institutes (High Schools too!). I have a soon-to-be published Open Source package for connecting Microsoft Power BI to a Student's Moodle site, using Moodle's built-in Mobile Rest API, and an auth token from the Moodle Account Settings page. Documented and committed with Conventional Commits. in a way meant to be walked through as a lab in Grades 7+ (Jr. High) Hundreds of wonderful people from powerlifting events & the gym. ^QFLn0L0I Tech Ramblings... ^BqBERfM2 Self Improvement, Leadership, Certs & more...

(Intro, Hello \ud83d\udc4b) \u00b6 Greg + Atlassian ~= \ud83d\udc98 ? April 14, 2022 Hello, My History in Quick Bullet Points \u00b6 I was going to start a service to streamline web development agencies utilizing Atlassian Jira, Customer Service Management, and Work Management. Have ran that service, a DevOps rooted, Jira-based process/platform with three agencies, firstly my previous agency, my new business, Dalyle DevOps Inc, and couple experiments with friends on the side. I am a fan, but also know why I am using GitHub instead of Bitbucket ;) I would LOVE to help change that, make the world love Bitbucket more, it's really great, and truly amazing when tied into the entire Atlassian ecosystem. Let's chat about what I have found in the real-world with many clients given options! SaaS (Agency Custom CMS, Website Design/Maintenance/Hosting Packages), and arguably PaaS, provider for 17+ years. Competitive nature drives me. Learning fuels me. Seeing a change someone made to my code, or watching someone do something because of what we discussed, what I taught/showed them, what they wanted to show me, is effin enthralling . I can probably give you a tip a day for at least a year on keyboard shortcuts alone . Here's some to try: ProTip WIN+K connects Bluetooth devices, like your headphones or mouse, so lovely, newer one for me. \u00b6 ProTip WIN + ALT + D = Show Calendar \u00b6 ProTip Install Microsoft PowerToys and it has a keyboard shortcut helper that lets you press WIN+SHIFT+? to see what shortcuts are available on any screen! \u00b6 PowerToys Shortcut Guide utility for Windows | Microsoft Docs PowerToys Video Conference Mute utility for Windows | Microsoft Docs ProTip #Advanced WIN + CTRL + SHIFT + B = Restart Graphics Driver - If things are acting funky, perhaps after connecting a secondary display. \u00b6 Dale Carnegie course at 16 years old taught me how to speak in public, and gave me opportunities to hone that skill. #PublicSpeaking Being a JDRF Ambassador from 16-24 years old gave me several public speaking opportunities to share my diabetes story amongst hundreds of people (~500 max I believe). Not just people, but prominent Calgary business people, people who can afford a rather expensive dinner at a beautiful gala. The 801 - Principal Full Stack Engineer, Distribution Network posting discussed exciting company-wide and conference speaking! Bro, I can enthuse a crowd! Have to for Powerlifting! Amateur Competitive Powerlifting taught me teamwork, how to be coached, and how to coach, including coaching some to their personal bests time and time again! #FeelsGood Why Atlassian? \u00b6 Atlassian feels like it could be the right place for my weird mix of talents and interests. Hardcore geek growing up, programming and hacking away on Linux from the wee age of 11, just to try to get a router setup in my house, when you couldn't just pick one up in my then small town. This could be a bit of a mess, especially as I keep growing it. This started as a Resume and Cover Letter for you, Atlassian, so that I could include different sections easily within Obsidian. \"Transclude\" them if we get into Obsidian language, which we should, since it's legit. I hope that this shows some of my communication skills. I will learn and refine as we go, always getting better. I have a weird mixture of entrepreunership, hardcore programming for 17+ years with primarily public-sector clientele, and a deep desire, 8+ years, of trying to figure out how to manage life, projects, etc... ( Project Management ), and Marketing simply in my blood. Obsidian, tagging, markdown, etc... all has let me communicate at the speed I think. Some may say that's not such a great thing, haha. Really hope to chat. My email does become a blackhole sometimes, and my phone dies, but please try, and try again. I won't waste your time.

This could be a bit of a mess, especially as I keep growing it. This started as a Resume and Cover Letter for you, Atlassian, so that I could include different sections easily within Obsidian. \"Transclude\" them if we get into Obsidian language, which we should, since it's legit. I hope that this shows some of my communication skills. I will learn and refine as we go, always getting better. I have a weird mixture of entrepreunership, hardcore programming for 17+ years with primarily public-sector clientele, and a deep desire, 8+ years, of trying to figure out how to manage life, projects, etc... ( Project Management ), and Marketing simply in my blood. Obsidian, tagging, markdown, etc... all has let me communicate at the speed I think. Some may say that's not such a great thing, haha.

It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with SemVer , by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages. The commit message should be structured as follows: <type>[optional scope]: <description> [optional body] [optional footer(s)] The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library: fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning). feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning). BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE: , or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type . types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the the Angular convention ) recommends build: , chore: , ci: , docs: , style: , refactor: , perf: , test: , and others. footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format . Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE). A scope may be provided to a commit\u2019s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays . Examples \u00b6 Commit message with description and breaking change footer \u00b6 feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files Commit message with ! to draw attention to breaking change \u00b6 feat!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped Commit message with scope and ! to draw attention to breaking change \u00b6 feat(api)!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped Commit message with both ! and BREAKING CHANGE footer \u00b6 chore!: drop support for Node 6 BREAKING CHANGE: use JavaScript features not available in Node 6. Commit message with no body \u00b6 docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG Commit message with scope \u00b6 feat(lang): add Polish language Commit message with multi-paragraph body and multiple footers \u00b6 fix: prevent racing of requests Introduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss incoming responses other than from latest request. Remove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are obsolete now.

Commits MUST be prefixed with a type, which consists of a noun, feat , fix , etc., followed by the OPTIONAL scope, OPTIONAL ! , and REQUIRED terminal colon and space. The type feat MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library. The type fix MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application. A scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., fix(parser): A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix. The description is a short summary of the code changes, e.g., fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string . A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description. A commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline separated paragraphs. One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each footer MUST consist of a word token, followed by either a :<space> or <space># separator, followed by a string value (this is inspired by the git trailer convention ). A footer\u2019s token MUST use - in place of whitespace characters, e.g., Acked-by (this helps differentiate the footer section from a multi-paragraph body). An exception is made for BREAKING CHANGE , which MAY also be used as a token. A footer\u2019s value MAY contain spaces and newlines, and parsing MUST terminate when the next valid footer token/separator pair is observed. Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit, or as an entry in the footer. If included as a footer, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon, space, and description, e.g., BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files . If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a ! immediately before the : . If ! is used, BREAKING CHANGE: MAY be omitted from the footer section, and the commit description SHALL be used to describe the breaking change. Types other than feat and fix MAY be used in your commit messages, e.g., docs: updated ref docs. The units of information that make up Conventional Commits MUST NOT be treated as case sensitive by implementors, with the exception of BREAKING CHANGE which MUST be uppercase. BREAKING-CHANGE MUST be synonymous with BREAKING CHANGE, when used as a token in a footer. Why Use Conventional Commits \u00b6 Automatically generating CHANGELOGs. Automatically determining a semantic version bump (based on the types of commits landed). Communicating the nature of changes to teammates, the public, and other stakeholders. Triggering build and publish processes. Making it easier for people to contribute to your projects, by allowing them to explore a more structured commit history. FAQ \u00b6 How should I deal with commit messages in the initial development phase? \u00b6 We recommend that you proceed as if you\u2019ve already released the product. Typically somebody , even if it\u2019s your fellow software developers, is using your software. They\u2019ll want to know what\u2019s fixed, what breaks etc. Are the types in the commit title uppercase or lowercase? \u00b6 Any casing may be used, but it\u2019s best to be consistent. What do I do if the commit conforms to more than one of the commit types? \u00b6 Go back and make multiple commits whenever possible. Part of the benefit of Conventional Commits is its ability to drive us to make more organized commits and PRs. Doesn\u2019t this discourage rapid development and fast iteration? \u00b6 It discourages moving fast in a disorganized way. It helps you be able to move fast long term across multiple projects with varied contributors. Might Conventional Commits lead developers to limit the type of commits they make because they\u2019ll be thinking in the types provided? \u00b6 Conventional Commits encourages us to make more of certain types of commits such as fixes. Other than that, the flexibility of Conventional Commits allows your team to come up with their own types and change those types over time. How does this relate to SemVer? \u00b6 fix type commits should be translated to PATCH releases. feat type commits should be translated to MINOR releases. Commits with BREAKING CHANGE in the commits, regardless of type, should be translated to MAJOR releases. How should I version my extensions to the Conventional Commits Specification, e.g. @jameswomack/conventional-commit-spec ? \u00b6 We recommend using SemVer to release your own extensions to this specification (and encourage you to make these extensions!) What do I do if I accidentally use the wrong commit type? \u00b6 When you used a type that\u2019s of the spec but not the correct type, e.g. fix instead of feat \u00b6 Prior to merging or releasing the mistake, we recommend using git rebase -i to edit the commit history. After release, the cleanup will be different according to what tools and processes you use. When you used a type not of the spec, e.g. feet instead of feat \u00b6 In a worst case scenario, it\u2019s not the end of the world if a commit lands that does not meet the Conventional Commits specification. It simply means that commit will be missed by tools that are based on the spec. Do all my contributors need to use the Conventional Commits specification? \u00b6 No! If you use a squash based workflow on Git lead maintainers can clean up the commit messages as they\u2019re merged\u2014adding no workload to casual committers. A common workflow for this is to have your git system automatically squash commits from a pull request and present a form for the lead maintainer to enter the proper git commit message for the merge. How does Conventional Commits handle revert commits? \u00b6 Reverting code can be complicated: are you reverting multiple commits? if you revert a feature, should the next release instead be a patch? Conventional Commits does not make an explicit effort to define revert behavior. Instead we leave it to tooling authors to use the flexibility of types and footers to develop their logic for handling reverts. One recommendation is to use the revert type, and a footer that references the commit SHAs that are being reverted: revert: let us never again speak of the noodle incident Refs: 676104e, a215868","title":"Conventional Commits"},{"location":"career/vendors-tools/obsidian/Conventional%20Commits/#conventional-commits","text":"","title":"Conventional Commits"},{"location":"career/vendors-tools/obsidian/Conventional%20Commits/#excerpt","text":"A specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages","title":"Excerpt"},{"location":"career/vendors-tools/obsidian/Conventional%20Commits/#conventional-commits-100","text":"","title":"Conventional Commits 1.0.0"},{"location":"career/vendors-tools/obsidian/Conventional%20Commits/#summary","text":"The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages.

April 14, 2022 Hello, My History in Quick Bullet Points \u00b6 I was going to start a service to streamline web development agencies utilizing Atlassian Jira, Customer Service Management, and Work Management. Have ran that service, a DevOps rooted, Jira-based process/platform with three agencies, firstly my previous agency, my new business, Dalyle DevOps Inc, and couple experiments with friends on the side. I am a fan, but also know why I am using GitHub instead of Bitbucket ;) I would LOVE to help change that, make the world love Bitbucket more, it's really great, and truly amazing when tied into the entire Atlassian ecosystem. Let's chat about what I have found in the real-world with many clients given options! SaaS (Agency Custom CMS, Website Design/Maintenance/Hosting Packages), and arguably PaaS, provider for 17+ years. Competitive nature drives me. Learning fuels me. Seeing a change someone made to my code, or watching someone do something because of what we discussed, what I taught/showed them, what they wanted to show me, is effin enthralling . I can probably give you a tip a day for at least a year on keyboard shortcuts alone . Here's some to try: ProTip WIN+K connects Bluetooth devices, like your headphones or mouse, so lovely, newer one for me. \u00b6 ProTip WIN + ALT + D = Show Calendar \u00b6 ProTip Install Microsoft PowerToys and it has a keyboard shortcut helper that lets you press WIN+SHIFT+? to see what shortcuts are available on any screen! \u00b6 PowerToys Shortcut Guide utility for Windows | Microsoft Docs PowerToys Video Conference Mute utility for Windows | Microsoft Docs ProTip #Advanced WIN + CTRL + SHIFT + B = Restart Graphics Driver - If things are acting funky, perhaps after connecting a secondary display. \u00b6 Dale Carnegie course at 16 years old taught me how to speak in public, and gave me opportunities to hone that skill. #PublicSpeaking Being a JDRF Ambassador from 16-24 years old gave me several public speaking opportunities to share my diabetes story amongst hundreds of people (~500 max I believe).

Requirements \u2705At least 3 years of Web Back End development experience; more experienced candidates are welcome 17.65 years at last agency, Media Dog Productions Inc. 5ish years before that as teen working on PHP web backends. Started with some gross Perl cgi-bin stuff even. Lol. You old enough to know that stuff? I have a textbook downstairs, no joke. World Skills Competition in High School for Web Dev/Design (3rd place) ~23 years total web dev experience Consultant, contractor, regarded pro when someone works with me. Hate that though, I just happen to know some other stuff since I have lived and breathed tech, then web, since I was in Grade 2. \u2705Strong knowledge of Java, Scala, Node.js -= Adobe ColdFusion Certification - Pro - CFML is compiled (transpiled?) down into Java ByteCode, and then runs on a JVM. - Been developing and supporting sites with that for over a dozen years. - Comfortable managing jvm servers, jrun4, (tomcat?) - No problem Very Strong knowledge of Node.js, program in it near daily, so much over last few years. Can even discuss pros/cons of Node on Windows, Linux, WSL, VMs, etc.. Used in almost every DevOps Pipeline I've setup, except for some legacy projects and those which we experimented with adding the output of npm run prod to the site source code, to avoid having node run anywhere, save the CPU cycles. It sort of works but the code base can get large. Can we please discuss what you do and what I do, then make something awesomer?!?! Then share it for free with the world as an open source best practice guide? Then make a worker owned co-op to use as a training center to fetch talent from? A worker owned co-op focused on re-training people who lost their physical jobs form COVID, or want to transfer out... Home Builders Mechanics Systems/process oriented people. Foreign Workers ESL Workers Can really provide some extra support there. Blarg, distracted, more on that in Blueprint to a Better Web Industry v2022.1 2022-03-30.pdf \u2705Strong knowledge of GraphQL and API architecture Please see comments below regarding [[Statamic CMS]], but also various other experience with both Headless CMS and various query languages (SQL, Domain Specific, Sieve Mail Filters, so many...)

Will we get that cool? \u2705\u2b50Experience with AWS Cloud Computing I have been running production hosting for public sector companies for over a dozen years in the cloud, with [[Linode]] and [[DigitalOcean]]. I have taken some practice tests for the [[AWS DevOps Certification]], and pass, but trip-up on the Amazon terminology. Created various local dev, back office, and lab Virtual Networks with [[XCP and Xen]], [[HyperV]], working on [[Proxmox]]. No problem to adapt. Chatting with other AWS Architects, I have actually been able to suggest AWS services to help their systems and pipelines. \u2705\ud83d\udc76 Experience with NoSQL DB solutions (Mongo, Dynamo, Redis) Experienced, not in prod, but can definitely adapt. Very solid understanding of concepts behind [[NoSQL]]. One site is live using [[Statamic CMS]] that uses [[Markdown]] and [[YAML]] files for content, rather than Headless-potential CMS [[GraphQL]] API. Algolia Search Service indexing built-in. Algolia Search Service#Algolia InstantSearch AIS is pretty cool for quick, JS or React search components. Man, I could really help you here thinking about it. Statamic, headless CMS, etc. are so run-of-the-mill for me at this point that I forget to mention them. \u2705\u2b50 Comfortable with the Unix command lines Are you using Unix (e.g. [[FreeBSD]]) or Linux (e.g. [[Ubuntu]], CentOS , Red Hat , RHEL , Manjaro , etc.)?

#screencast 2022-05-12 at 12:58:34 Customer Success Manager (Remote) - webclip Another way to think about this distinction comes from another friend, Tim Urban. He says it\u2019s like the difference between the cook and the chef. While these terms are often used interchangeably, there is an important nuance. The chef is a trailblazer, the person who invents recipes. He knows the raw ingredients and how to combine them. The cook, who reasons by analogy, uses a recipe. He creates something, perhaps with slight variations, that\u2019s already been created. The difference between reasoning by first principles and reasoning by analogy is like the difference between being a chef and being a cook. If the cook lost the recipe, he\u2019d be screwed. The chef, on the other hand, understands the flavor profiles and combinations at such a fundamental level that he doesn\u2019t even use a recipe. He has real knowledge as opposed to know-how. https://fs.blog/first-principles/ Peretti recognized the first principles of online popularity and used them to take a new approach to journalism. He also ignored SEO, saying, \u201cInstead of making content robots like, it was more satisfying to make content humans want to share.\u201d [8] Unfortunately for us, we share a lot of cat videos.","title":"Customer Success Manager   Application   Greg Stevens   2022 05 12"},{"location":"organizations/memory-timely/What%20I%20Would%20Do%20With%20100%20People/2022-05-16%20What%20I%20Would%20Do%20with%20100%20People%20at%20Memory%20AS%202022-05-16%2010.58.07.excalidraw/","tags":["excalidraw"],"text":"\u26a0 Switch to EXCALIDRAW VIEW in the MORE OPTIONS menu of this document. \u26a0 Text Elements \u00b6 What I Would Do with 100 People at Memory AS ^RR12EiB7 Tools ^UpPxOktF Effective Cross-Functional Teams ^8wgJ9cJP greg+career@stevens.pro https://career.stevens.pro/ v22.1.0-draft.1 2022-05-16 ^ciCoOudF DevOps Teams ^iaLG1RHp Strategies, Processes, Systems, etc. ^YOs2JKKu Techniques, Efficiency ^tmTSIpkv Training ^ueBfMVlt From I-Shaped to T-Shaped \u2013 Why DevOps Professionals Need to be Multi-Skilled from the DevOps Institute ^S35Rm9dS ^8bumC5XW Develop/Train, Attract, & Support \"T-Shaped\" Professionals ^0n5KDoR2 ^YFQUyQML 100 People!

In philosophy , first principles are from First Cause [1] attitudes and taught by Aristotelians , and nuanced versions of first principles are referred to as postulates by Kantians . [2] In mathematics , first principles are referred to as axioms or postulates. In physics and other sciences, theoretical work is said to be from first principles, or ab initio , if it starts directly at the level of established science and does not make assumptions such as empirical model and parameter fitting. First principles thinking consists of deriving things to their fundamental proven axioms in the given arena, before reasoning up by asking which ones are relevant to the question at hand, then cross referencing conclusions based on chosen axioms and making sure conclusions don't violate any fundamental laws. Physicists include counterintuitive concepts with reiteration . In formal logic[ edit ] \u00b6 In a formal logical system , that is, a set of propositions that are consistent with one another, it is possible that some of the statements can be deduced from other statements. For example, in the syllogism , \"All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; Socrates is mortal\" the last claim can be deduced from the first two. A first principle is an axiom that cannot be deduced from any other within that system. The classic example is that of Euclid's Elements ; its hundreds of geometric propositions can be deduced from a set of definitions, postulates, and common notions: all three types constitute first principles. Philosophy in general[ edit ] \u00b6 In philosophy \"first principles\" are from First Cause [3] attitudes commonly referred to as a priori terms and arguments, which are contrasted to a posteriori terms, reasoning or arguments, in that the former is simply assumed and exist prior to the reasoning process and the latter are deduced or inferred after the initial reasoning process. First principles are generally treated in the realm of philosophy known as epistemology , but are an important factor in any metaphysical speculation. In philosophy \"first principles\" are often somewhat synonymous with a priori , datum and axiomatic reasoning . Aristotle's contribution[ edit ] \u00b6 Terence Irwin writes: When Aristotle explains in general terms what he tries to do in his philosophical works, he says he is looking for \"first principles\" (or \"origins\"; archai ): In every systematic inquiry (methodos) where there are first principles, or causes, or elements, knowledge and science result from acquiring knowledge of these; for we think we know something just in case we acquire knowledge of the primary causes, the primary first principles, all the way to the elements. It is clear, then, that in the science of nature as elsewhere, we should try first to determine questions about the first principles. The naturally proper direction of our road is from things better known and clearer to us, to things that are clearer and better known by nature; for the things that are known to us are not the same as the things known unconditionally (hapl\u00f4s). Hence it is necessary for us to progress, following this procedure, from the things that are less clear by nature, but clearer to us, towards things that are clearer and better known by nature. (Phys. 184a10\u201321) The connection between knowledge and first principles is not axiomatic as expressed in Aristotle's account of a first principle (in one sense) as \"the first basis from which a thing is known\" (Met. 1013a14\u201315). The search for first principles is not peculiar to philosophy; philosophy shares this aim with biological, meteorological, and historical inquiries, among others. But Aristotle's references to first principles in this opening passage of the Physics and at the start of other philosophical inquiries imply that it is a primary task of philosophy. [4] Descartes[ edit ] \u00b6 Profoundly influenced by Euclid , Descartes was a rationalist who invented the foundationalist system of philosophy. He used the method of doubt , now called Cartesian doubt , to systematically doubt everything he could possibly doubt until he was left with what he saw as purely indubitable truths. Using these self-evident propositions as his axioms, or foundations, he went on to deduce his entire body of knowledge from them. The foundations are also called a priori truths. His most famous proposition is \"Je pense, donc je suis.\" ( I think, therefore I am , or Cogito ergo sum ) Descartes describes the concept of a first principle in the following excerpt from the preface to the Principles of Philosophy (1644): I should have desired, in the first place, to explain in it what philosophy is, by commencing with the most common matters, as, for example, that the word philosophy signifies the study of wisdom, and that by wisdom is to be understood not merely prudence in the management of affairs, but a perfect knowledge of all that man can know, as well for the conduct of his life as for the preservation of his health and the discovery of all the arts, and that knowledge to subserve these ends must necessarily be deduced from first causes; so that in order to study the acquisition of it (which is properly called [284] philosophizing), we must commence with the investigation of those first causes which are called Principles. Now, these principles must possess two conditions: in the first place, they must be so clear and evident that the human mind, when it attentively considers them, cannot doubt their truth; in the second place, the knowledge of other things must be so dependent on them as that though the principles themselves may indeed be known apart from what depends on them, the latter cannot nevertheless be known apart from the former. It will accordingly be necessary thereafter to endeavor so to deduce from those principles the knowledge of the things that depend on them, as that there may be nothing in the whole series of deductions which is not perfectly manifest. [5] In physics[ edit ] \u00b6 In physics , a calculation is said to be from first principles , or ab initio , if it starts directly at the level of established laws of physics and does not make assumptions such as empirical model and fitting parameters. For example, calculation of electronic structure using Schr\u00f6dinger's equation within a set of approximations that do not include fitting the model to experimental data is an ab initio approach .

NLP has been adopted by some hypnotherapists and also by companies that run seminars marketed as leadership training to businesses and government agencies.There is no scientific evidence supporting the claims made by NLP advocates, and it has been discredited as a pseudoscience. Scientific reviews state that NLP is based on outdated metaphors of how the brain works that are inconsistent with current neurological theory and contain numerous factual errors.

Sometimes a version is just a number, but sometimes what we really want is a poem . Semver has a spec, but Sentimental Versioning has not a spec, but a guide; just some whimsical suggestions. If you use sentimental versioning you should not copy another sentimental versioning system. You should do something creative and original. You may explain the system you create, if the beauty is enhanced by understanding it. You may just improvise new numbers from your mood on that day. The only important thing, is that the version number must be meaningful to you, the author. Interpreting the previous paragraph according to the specific meanings defined in RFC2119 for \u201cshould\u201d , \u201cshould not\u201d , \u201cmay\u201d , and \u201cmust\u201d is entirely optional . Inspiration \u00b6 Following are some projects that use sentimental versioning. Draw inspiration from the way their version numbers express intangible aspects of the project, and are a work of art on their own. Node.js \u00b6 by Ryan Dahl \u00b6 node.js is like a rebellious teenager. It skips class and plays in a punk rock band - yet still gets straight A\u2019s. Its versioning system expresses its dual nature beautifully. Version numbers alternate between even and odd, and between stable and unstable. In unstable versions node makes its own rules and sticks it to the man. In stable versions node wears a long sleeve shirt over its tattoos and works at fortune 500 companies (fighting the system from the inside?). Some critics say that node is part of the establishment now, citing that it\u2019s been a very long time since its last album was released, version 0.12 having been in the works for over a year. While this accusation may carry some weight, you cannot put a time frame on creativity, and you must admit that node\u2019s use of sentimental versioning is a beautiful expression of its own internal conflicts. Backbone \u00b6 by Jeremy Ashkenas \u00b6 Jeremy calls his versioning system romantic (which is very sentimental of him) It looks like semver ( major.minor.patch ), but with a personal meaning. For him, a patch is a change you probably won\u2019t notice, and a minor change is when you change it a little bit. A major change is when you make a major release (notice the circular definition!). A major change can be anything or nothing. He says every change should be backwards compatible. But what does \u201cbackwards compatible\u201d mean to Jeremy? That is up to you to decide. Jeremy\u2019s use of sentimental versioning expresses how backbone is his masterpiece, and he, its master. by Donald Knuth \u00b6 In his seminal text layout system, TeX, and his equally brilliant typeface design system, METAFONT, Donald uses a versioning number system that asymptotically approaches perfection. The version numbers of TeX approach \u03c0 (the current version is 3.14159265 ) and the version numbers of METAFONT approach e . It has been prophesied that the last change not be made until after the day Donald ascends to heaven on a shining cloud. At that point, Donald will make one last ssh connection down from heaven to his server at Stanford University and set the version number unto \u03c0 exactly . At that point all remaining bugs will be declared features, and the output from TeX will remain the same for all eternity. Realization \u00b6 What ever happens, not everyone will understand your intentions, possibly your genius will not be recognized within your lifetime. But we did not choose the life of the artist for fame and certainly not for fortune - But rather, a dedication to aesthetic beauty and self expression. In this spirit, go forth, and create beautiful versions! .","title":"Sentimentalversioning.org"},{"location":"philosophies/sentimentalversioning.org/#sentimental-versioning","text":"","title":"Sentimental Versioning"},{"location":"philosophies/sentimentalversioning.org/#version-one-dot-oh-okay-then","text":"","title":"Version One dot Oh, okay then."},{"location":"philosophies/sentimentalversioning.org/#by-dominic-tarr","text":"Some version number systems aspire to merely label changes in an interface, but there is much in the human experience that lies outside of this.

Kaizen also applies to processes, such as purchasing and logistics , that cross organizational boundaries into the supply chain . [1] It has been applied in healthcare, [2] psychotherapy , [3] life coaching , government, and banking. By improving standardized programs and processes, kaizen aims to eliminate waste and redundancies ( lean manufacturing ). Kaizen was first practiced in Japanese businesses after World War II , influenced in part by American business and quality-management teachers, and most notably as part of The Toyota Way . It has since spread throughout the world and has been applied to environments outside business and productivity. [4] Overview[ edit ] \u00b6 The Japanese word kaizen means \"change for better\", inherent meaning of either \"continuous\" or \"philosophy\" in Japanese dictionaries and in everyday use. The word refers to any improvement, one-time or continuous, large or small, in the same sense as the English word \" improvement \". [5] However, given the common practice in Japan of labeling industrial or business improvement techniques with the word \"kaizen\", particularly the practices spearheaded by Toyota, the word \"kaizen\" in English is typically applied to measures for implementing continuous improvement , especially those with a \"Japanese philosophy\". The discussion below focuses on such interpretations of the word, as frequently used in the context of modern management discussions. Two kaizen approaches have been distinguished: [6] Point Kaizen[ edit ] \u00b6 Point Kaizen is one of the most commonly implemented types of kaizen.[ citation needed ] It happens very quickly and usually without much planning. As soon as something is found broken or incorrect, quick and immediate measures are taken to correct the issues. These measures are generally small, isolated and easy to implement.; however, they can have a huge impact. In some cases, it is also possible that the positive effects of point kaizen in one area can reduce or eliminate benefits of point kaizen in some other area. Examples of point kaizen include a shop inspection by a supervisor and he finds broken materials or other small issues, and then asks the owner of the shop to perform a quick kaizen ( 5S ) to rectify those issues. Or a line worker notices a potential improvement in efficiency by placing the materials needed in another order or closer to the production line in order to minimize downtime. System Kaizen[ edit ] \u00b6 System kaizen is accomplished in an organized manner and is devised to address system-level problems in an organization. It is an upper-level strategic planning method for a short period of time. Line Kaizen[ edit ] \u00b6 Plane Kaizen[ edit ] \u00b6 This is the next upper level of line kaizen, in that several lines are connected together. In modern terminologies, this can also be described as a value stream, where instead of traditional departments, the organization is structured into product lines or families and value streams. It can be visualized as changes or improvements made to one line being implemented to multiple other lines or processes. Cube Kaizen[ edit ] \u00b6 Cube kaizen describes the situation where all the points of the planes are connected to each other and no point is disjointed from any other. This would resemble a situation where Lean has spread across the entire organization. Improvements are made up and down through the plane, or upstream or downstream, including the complete organization, suppliers and customers. This might require some changes in the standard business processes as well. Kaizen is a daily process, the purpose of which goes beyond simple productivity improvement. It is also a process that, when done correctly, humanizes the workplace, eliminates overly hard work ( muri ), and teaches people how to perform experiments on their work using the scientific method and how to learn to spot and eliminate waste in business processes. In all, the process suggests a humanized approach to workers and to increasing productivity: \"The idea is to nurture the company's people as much as it is to praise and encourage participation in kaizen activities.\" [7] Successful implementation requires \"the participation of workers in the improvement.\" [8] People at all levels of an organization participate in kaizen, from the CEO down to janitorial staff, as well as external stakeholders when applicable. Kaizen is most commonly associated with manufacturing operations, as at Toyota, but has also been used in non-manufacturing environments. [9] The format for kaizen can be individual, suggestion system, small group, or large group. At Toyota, it is usually a local improvement within a workstation or local area and involves a small group in improving their own work environment and productivity. This group is often guided through the kaizen process by a line supervisor; sometimes this is the line supervisor's key role. Kaizen on a broad, cross-departmental scale in companies, generates total quality management , and frees human efforts through improving productivity using machines and computing power.[ citation needed ] While kaizen (at Toyota) usually delivers small improvements, the culture of continual aligned small improvements and standardization yields large results in terms of overall improvement in productivity. This philosophy differs from the \" command and control \" improvement programs (e.g., Business Process Improvement) of the mid-20th century. Kaizen methodology includes making changes and monitoring results, then adjusting. Large-scale pre-planning and extensive project scheduling are replaced by smaller experiments, which can be rapidly adapted as new improvements are suggested.[ citation needed ] In modern usage, it is designed to address a particular issue over the course of a week and is referred to as a \"kaizen blitz\" or \"kaizen event\". [10] [11] These are limited in scope, and issues that arise from them are typically used in later blitzes.[ citation needed ] A person who makes a large contribution in the successful implementation of kaizen during kaizen events is awarded the title of \"Zenkai\". In the 21st century, business consultants in various countries have engaged in widespread adoption and sharing of the kaizen framework as a way to help their clients restructure and refocus their business processes . History[ edit ] \u00b6 The small-step work improvement approach was developed in the USA under Training Within Industry program (TWI Job Methods). [12] Instead of encouraging large, radical changes to achieve desired goals, these methods recommended that organizations introduce small improvements, preferably ones that could be implemented on the same day. The major reason was that during WWII there was neither time nor resources for large and innovative changes in the production of war equipment. [13] The essence of the approach came down to improving the use of the existing workforce and technologies. As part of the Marshall Plan after World War II , American occupation forces brought in experts to help with the rebuilding of Japanese industry while the Civil Communications Section (CCS) developed a management training program that taught statistical control methods as part of the overall material. Homer Sarasohn and Charles Protzman developed and taught this course in 1949\u20131950. Sarasohn recommended W. Edwards Deming for further training in statistical methods. The Economic and Scientific Section (ESS) group was also tasked with improving Japanese management skills and Edgar McVoy was instrumental in bringing Lowell Mellen to Japan to properly install the Training Within Industry (TWI) programs in 1951. The ESS group had a training film to introduce TWI's three \"J\" programs: Job Instruction, Job Methods and Job Relations. Titled \"Improvement in Four Steps\" ( Kaizen eno Yon Dankai ) it thus introduced kaizen to Japan. For the pioneering, introduction, and implementation of kaizen in Japan, the Emperor of Japan awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure to Dr. Deming in 1960. Subsequently, the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) instituted the annual Deming Prizes for achievement in quality and dependability of products. On October 18, 1989, JUSE awarded the Deming Prize to Florida Power & Light Co. (FPL), based in the US, for its exceptional accomplishments in process and quality-control management, making it the first company outside Japan to win the Deming Prize. [14] Kaoru Ishikawa took up this concept to define how continuous improvement or kaizen can be applied to processes, as long as all the variables of the process are known. [15] Implementation[ edit ] \u00b6 The Toyota Production System is known for kaizen, where all line personnel are expected to stop their moving production line in case of any abnormality and, along with their supervisor, suggest an improvement to resolve the abnormality which may initiate a kaizen. The cycle of kaizen activity can be defined as: \"Plan \u2192 Do \u2192 Check \u2192 Act\". This is also known as the Shewhart cycle , Deming cycle, or PDCA . Another technique used in conjunction with PDCA is the 5 Whys , which is a form of root cause analysis in which the user asks a series of five \"why\" questions about a failure that has occurred, basing each subsequent question on the answer to the previous. [17] [18] There are normally a series of causes stemming from one root cause, [19] and they can be visualized using fishbone diagrams or tables. The Five Whys can be used as a foundational tool in personal improvement, [20] or as a means to create wealth. [21] Masaaki Imai made the term famous in his book Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success . [1] In the Toyota Way Fieldbook , Liker and Meier discuss the kaizen blitz and kaizen burst (or kaizen event) approaches to continuous improvement. A kaizen blitz, or rapid improvement, is a focused activity on a particular process or activity. The basic concept is to identify and quickly remove waste. Another approach is that of the kaizen burst, a specific kaizen activity on a particular process in the value stream . [22] Kaizen facilitators generally[ weasel words ] go through training and certification before attempting a Kaizen project.[ citation needed ] In the 1990s, Professor Iwao Kobayashi published his book 20 Keys to Workplace Improvement and created a practical, step-by-step improvement framework called \"the 20 Keys\". He identified 20 operations focus areas which should be improved to attain holistic and sustainable change. He went further and identified the 5 levels of implementation for each of these 20 focus areas. 4 of the focus areas are called Foundation Keys. According to the 20 Keys, these foundation keys should be launched ahead of the others in order to form a strong constitution in the company. The four foundation keys are: Key 1 \u2013 Cleaning and Organizing to Make Work Easy, which is based on the 5S methodology. Key 2 \u2013 Goal Alignment/Rationalizing the System Key 3 \u2013 Small Group Activities Key 4 \u2013 Leading and Site Technology In popular culture[ edit ] \u00b6 Kaizen-85 is the name of the AI aboard the leisure space ship Nautilus in the game Event 0 .

Most features are configurable with command line options which also include default values to minimize the complexity of the program's invocation. Siege allows you to stress a web server with n number of users t number of times, where n and t are defined by the user. It records the duration time of the test as well as the duration of each single transaction. It reports the number of transactions, elapsed time, bytes transferred, response time, transaction rate, concurrency and the number of times the server responded OK, that is status code 200. Siege was designed and implemented by Jeffrey Fulmer in his position as Webmaster for Armstrong World Industries. It was modeled in part after Lincoln Stein's torture.pl and it's data reporting is almost identical.

A tag is essentially a clickable search through your entire Vault for a term. For example, clicking on #tags will bring up a search with all notes that contain that tag. Most people use them for broad categories of things, like a class you might be taking notes in or a type of idea. Some Zettelkasten practitioners like to use them as \"entry points\" for thinking about connected ideas. But ultimately, they are flexible enough that you can use them in any way you would like. Add tags \u00b6 Just type # followed by tag name like #tag1 You can also add tags in the notes YAML front matter like so: --- tags: - tag1 - tag2 --- Tag pane \u00b6 If you have the Tag pane plugin enabled, you will see a list of all tags that are used across all of your notes, sorted by frequency. Clicking on any of those will activate that search. This will allow you to search exact matches of a tag. For example, when clicking , as per usual, but if you want to find all instances of maintag with all subtags, you can still use the Search to look for #maintag . This is useful in cases where you have subcategories of things but you also want to be able to easily find all instances of the higher category. Allowed characters \u00b6 Spaces are not allowed in tags. So, to differentiate two or more words in a tag, you can use these case styles/formats: camelCase: #twoWords PascalCase: #TwoWords snake_case: #two_words kebab-case: #two-words The only symbols allowed are: _ (underscore) and - (dash) to separate words; / (forward slash) for nested tags .

It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with SemVer , by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages. The commit message should be structured as follows: <type>[optional scope]: <description> [optional body] [optional footer(s)] The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library: fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning). feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning). BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE: , or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type . types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the the Angular convention ) recommends build: , chore: , ci: , docs: , style: , refactor: , perf: , test: , and others. footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format . Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE). A scope may be provided to a commit\u2019s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays . Examples \u00b6 Commit message with description and breaking change footer \u00b6 feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files Commit message with ! to draw attention to breaking change \u00b6 feat!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped Commit message with scope and ! to draw attention to breaking change \u00b6 feat(api)!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped Commit message with both ! and BREAKING CHANGE footer \u00b6 chore!: drop support for Node 6 BREAKING CHANGE: use JavaScript features not available in Node 6. Commit message with no body \u00b6 docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG Commit message with scope \u00b6 feat(lang): add Polish language Commit message with multi-paragraph body and multiple footers \u00b6 fix: prevent racing of requests Introduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss incoming responses other than from latest request. Remove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are obsolete now. Reviewed-by: Z Refs: #123 Specification \u00b6 The key words \u201cMUST\u201d, \u201cMUST NOT\u201d, \u201cREQUIRED\u201d, \u201cSHALL\u201d, \u201cSHALL NOT\u201d, \u201cSHOULD\u201d, \u201cSHOULD NOT\u201d, \u201cRECOMMENDED\u201d, \u201cMAY\u201d, and \u201cOPTIONAL\u201d in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 . Commits MUST be prefixed with a type, which consists of a noun, feat , fix , etc., followed by the OPTIONAL scope, OPTIONAL ! , and REQUIRED terminal colon and space. The type feat MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library. The type fix MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application. A scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., fix(parser): A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix. The description is a short summary of the code changes, e.g., fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string . A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description. A commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline separated paragraphs. One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each footer MUST consist of a word token, followed by either a :<space> or <space># separator, followed by a string value (this is inspired by the git trailer convention ). A footer\u2019s token MUST use - in place of whitespace characters, e.g., Acked-by (this helps differentiate the footer section from a multi-paragraph body). An exception is made for BREAKING CHANGE , which MAY also be used as a token. A footer\u2019s value MAY contain spaces and newlines, and parsing MUST terminate when the next valid footer token/separator pair is observed. Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit, or as an entry in the footer. If included as a footer, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon, space, and description, e.g., BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files . If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a ! immediately before the : . If ! is used, BREAKING CHANGE: MAY be omitted from the footer section, and the commit description SHALL be used to describe the breaking change. Types other than feat and fix MAY be used in your commit messages, e.g., docs: updated ref docs. The units of information that make up Conventional Commits MUST NOT be treated as case sensitive by implementors, with the exception of BREAKING CHANGE which MUST be uppercase. BREAKING-CHANGE MUST be synonymous with BREAKING CHANGE, when used as a token in a footer. Why Use Conventional Commits \u00b6 Automatically generating CHANGELOGs. Automatically determining a semantic version bump (based on the types of commits landed). Communicating the nature of changes to teammates, the public, and other stakeholders. Triggering build and publish processes. Making it easier for people to contribute to your projects, by allowing them to explore a more structured commit history. FAQ \u00b6 How should I deal with commit messages in the initial development phase? \u00b6 We recommend that you proceed as if you\u2019ve already released the product. Typically somebody , even if it\u2019s your fellow software developers, is using your software. They\u2019ll want to know what\u2019s fixed, what breaks etc. Are the types in the commit title uppercase or lowercase? \u00b6 Any casing may be used, but it\u2019s best to be consistent. What do I do if the commit conforms to more than one of the commit types? \u00b6 Go back and make multiple commits whenever possible. Part of the benefit of Conventional Commits is its ability to drive us to make more organized commits and PRs. Doesn\u2019t this discourage rapid development and fast iteration? \u00b6 It discourages moving fast in a disorganized way. It helps you be able to move fast long term across multiple projects with varied contributors. Might Conventional Commits lead developers to limit the type of commits they make because they\u2019ll be thinking in the types provided? \u00b6 Conventional Commits encourages us to make more of certain types of commits such as fixes. Other than that, the flexibility of Conventional Commits allows your team to come up with their own types and change those types over time. How does this relate to SemVer? \u00b6 fix type commits should be translated to PATCH releases. feat type commits should be translated to MINOR releases. Commits with BREAKING CHANGE in the commits, regardless of type, should be translated to MAJOR releases. How should I version my extensions to the Conventional Commits Specification, e.g. @jameswomack/conventional-commit-spec ? \u00b6 We recommend using SemVer to release your own extensions to this specification (and encourage you to make these extensions!) What do I do if I accidentally use the wrong commit type? \u00b6 When you used a type that\u2019s of the spec but not the correct type, e.g. fix instead of feat \u00b6 Prior to merging or releasing the mistake, we recommend using git rebase -i to edit the commit history. After release, the cleanup will be different according to what tools and processes you use. When you used a type not of the spec, e.g. feet instead of feat \u00b6 In a worst case scenario, it\u2019s not the end of the world if a commit lands that does not meet the Conventional Commits specification. It simply means that commit will be missed by tools that are based on the spec. Do all my contributors need to use the Conventional Commits specification? \u00b6 No! If you use a squash based workflow on Git lead maintainers can clean up the commit messages as they\u2019re merged\u2014adding no workload to casual committers. A common workflow for this is to have your git system automatically squash commits from a pull request and present a form for the lead maintainer to enter the proper git commit message for the merge. How does Conventional Commits handle revert commits? \u00b6 Reverting code can be complicated: are you reverting multiple commits? if you revert a feature, should the next release instead be a patch? Conventional Commits does not make an explicit effort to define revert behavior. Instead we leave it to tooling authors to use the flexibility of types and footers to develop their logic for handling reverts. One recommendation is to use the revert type, and a footer that references the commit SHAs that are being reverted: revert: let us never again speak of the noodle incident Refs: 676104e, a215868","title":"Conventional Commits"},{"location":"tools/standards/Conventional%20Commits/#conventional-commits","text":"","title":"Conventional Commits"},{"location":"tools/standards/Conventional%20Commits/#excerpt","text":"A specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages","title":"Excerpt"},{"location":"tools/standards/Conventional%20Commits/#conventional-commits-100","text":"","title":"Conventional Commits 1.0.0"},{"location":"tools/standards/Conventional%20Commits/#summary","text":"The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages.

Kaizen also applies to processes, such as purchasing and logistics , that cross organizational boundaries into the supply chain . [1] It has been applied in healthcare, [2] psychotherapy , [3] life coaching , government, and banking. By improving standardized programs and processes, kaizen aims to eliminate waste and redundancies ( lean manufacturing ). Kaizen was first practiced in Japanese businesses after World War II , influenced in part by American business and quality-management teachers, and most notably as part of The Toyota Way . It has since spread throughout the world and has been applied to environments outside business and productivity. [4] Overview \u00b6 The Japanese word kaizen means \"change for better\", inherent meaning of either \"continuous\" or \"philosophy\" in Japanese dictionaries and in everyday use. The word refers to any improvement, one-time or continuous, large or small, in the same sense as the English word \" improvement \". [5] However, given the common practice in Japan of labeling industrial or business improvement techniques with the word \"kaizen\", particularly the practices spearheaded by Toyota, the word \"kaizen\" in English is typically applied to measures for implementing continuous improvement , especially those with a \"Japanese philosophy\". The discussion below focuses on such interpretations of the word, as frequently used in the context of modern management discussions. Two kaizen approaches have been distinguished: [6] Point Kaizen \u00b6 Point Kaizen is one of the most commonly implemented types of kaizen.[ citation needed ] It happens very quickly and usually without much planning. As soon as something is found broken or incorrect, quick and immediate measures are taken to correct the issues. These measures are generally small, isolated and easy to implement.; however, they can have a huge impact. In some cases, it is also possible that the positive effects of point kaizen in one area can reduce or eliminate benefits of point kaizen in some other area. Examples of point kaizen include a shop inspection by a supervisor and he finds broken materials or other small issues, and then asks the owner of the shop to perform a quick kaizen ( 5S ) to rectify those issues. Or a line worker notices a potential improvement in efficiency by placing the materials needed in another order or closer to the production line in order to minimize downtime. System Kaizen \u00b6 System kaizen is accomplished in an organized manner and is devised to address system-level problems in an organization. It is an upper-level strategic planning method for a short period of time. Line Kaizen \u00b6 Plane Kaizen \u00b6 This is the next upper level of line kaizen, in that several lines are connected together. In modern terminologies, this can also be described as a value stream, where instead of traditional departments, the organization is structured into product lines or families and value streams. It can be visualized as changes or improvements made to one line being implemented to multiple other lines or processes. Cube Kaizen \u00b6 Cube kaizen describes the situation where all the points of the planes are connected to each other and no point is disjointed from any other. This would resemble a situation where Lean has spread across the entire organization. Improvements are made up and down through the plane, or upstream or downstream, including the complete organization, suppliers and customers. This might require some changes in the standard business processes as well. Kaizen is a daily process, the purpose of which goes beyond simple productivity improvement. It is also a process that, when done correctly, humanizes the workplace, eliminates overly hard work ( muri ), and teaches people how to perform experiments on their work using the scientific method and how to learn to spot and eliminate waste in business processes. In all, the process suggests a humanized approach to workers and to increasing productivity: \"The idea is to nurture the company's people as much as it is to praise and encourage participation in kaizen activities.\" [7] Successful implementation requires \"the participation of workers in the improvement.\" [8] People at all levels of an organization participate in kaizen, from the CEO down to janitorial staff, as well as external stakeholders when applicable. Kaizen is most commonly associated with manufacturing operations, as at Toyota, but has also been used in non-manufacturing environments. [9] The format for kaizen can be individual, suggestion system, small group, or large group. At Toyota, it is usually a local improvement within a workstation or local area and involves a small group in improving their own work environment and productivity. This group is often guided through the kaizen process by a line supervisor; sometimes this is the line supervisor's key role. Kaizen on a broad, cross-departmental scale in companies, generates total quality management , and frees human efforts through improving productivity using machines and computing power.[ citation needed ] While kaizen (at Toyota) usually delivers small improvements, the culture of continual aligned small improvements and standardization yields large results in terms of overall improvement in productivity. This philosophy differs from the \" command and control \" improvement programs (e.g., Business Process Improvement) of the mid-20th century. Kaizen methodology includes making changes and monitoring results, then adjusting. Large-scale pre-planning and extensive project scheduling are replaced by smaller experiments, which can be rapidly adapted as new improvements are suggested.[ citation needed ] In modern usage, it is designed to address a particular issue over the course of a week and is referred to as a \"kaizen blitz\" or \"kaizen event\". [10] [11] These are limited in scope, and issues that arise from them are typically used in later blitzes.[ citation needed ] A person who makes a large contribution in the successful implementation of kaizen during kaizen events is awarded the title of \"Zenkai\". In the 21st century, business consultants in various countries have engaged in widespread adoption and sharing of the kaizen framework as a way to help their clients restructure and refocus their business processes . History \u00b6 The small-step work improvement approach was developed in the USA under Training Within Industry program (TWI Job Methods). [12] Instead of encouraging large, radical changes to achieve desired goals, these methods recommended that organizations introduce small improvements, preferably ones that could be implemented on the same day. The major reason was that during WWII there was neither time nor resources for large and innovative changes in the production of war equipment. [13] The essence of the approach came down to improving the use of the existing workforce and technologies. As part of the Marshall Plan after World War II , American occupation forces brought in experts to help with the rebuilding of Japanese industry while the Civil Communications Section (CCS) developed a management training program that taught statistical control methods as part of the overall material. Homer Sarasohn and Charles Protzman developed and taught this course in 1949\u20131950. Sarasohn recommended W. Edwards Deming for further training in statistical methods. The Economic and Scientific Section (ESS) group was also tasked with improving Japanese management skills and Edgar McVoy was instrumental in bringing Lowell Mellen to Japan to properly install the Training Within Industry (TWI) programs in 1951. The ESS group had a training film to introduce TWI's three \"J\" programs: Job Instruction, Job Methods and Job Relations. Titled \"Improvement in Four Steps\" ( Kaizen eno Yon Dankai ) it thus introduced kaizen to Japan. For the pioneering, introduction, and implementation of kaizen in Japan, the Emperor of Japan awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure to Dr. Deming in 1960. Subsequently, the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) instituted the annual Deming Prizes for achievement in quality and dependability of products. On October 18, 1989, JUSE awarded the Deming Prize to Florida Power & Light Co. (FPL), based in the US, for its exceptional accomplishments in process and quality-control management, making it the first company outside Japan to win the Deming Prize. [14] Kaoru Ishikawa took up this concept to define how continuous improvement or kaizen can be applied to processes, as long as all the variables of the process are known. [15] Implementation \u00b6 The Toyota Production System is known for kaizen, where all line personnel are expected to stop their moving production line in case of any abnormality and, along with their supervisor, suggest an improvement to resolve the abnormality which may initiate a kaizen. The cycle of kaizen activity can be defined as: \"Plan \u2192 Do \u2192 Check \u2192 Act\". This is also known as the Shewhart cycle , Deming cycle, or PDCA . Another technique used in conjunction with PDCA is the 5 Whys , which is a form of root cause analysis in which the user asks a series of five \"why\" questions about a failure that has occurred, basing each subsequent question on the answer to the previous. [17] [18] There are normally a series of causes stemming from one root cause, [19] and they can be visualized using fishbone diagrams or tables. The Five Whys can be used as a foundational tool in personal improvement, [20] or as a means to create wealth. [21] Masaaki Imai made the term famous in his book Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success . [1] In the Toyota Way Fieldbook , Liker and Meier discuss the kaizen blitz and kaizen burst (or kaizen event) approaches to continuous improvement. A kaizen blitz, or rapid improvement, is a focused activity on a particular process or activity. The basic concept is to identify and quickly remove waste. Another approach is that of the kaizen burst, a specific kaizen activity on a particular process in the value stream . [22] Kaizen facilitators generally[ weasel words ] go through training and certification before attempting a Kaizen project.[ citation needed ] In the 1990s, Professor Iwao Kobayashi published his book 20 Keys to Workplace Improvement and created a practical, step-by-step improvement framework called \"the 20 Keys\". He identified 20 operations focus areas which should be improved to attain holistic and sustainable change. He went further and identified the 5 levels of implementation for each of these 20 focus areas. 4 of the focus areas are called Foundation Keys. According to the 20 Keys, these foundation keys should be launched ahead of the others in order to form a strong constitution in the company. The four foundation keys are: Key 1 \u2013 Cleaning and Organizing to Make Work Easy, which is based on the 5S methodology. Key 2 \u2013 Goal Alignment/Rationalizing the System Key 3 \u2013 Small Group Activities Key 4 \u2013 Leading and Site Technology In popular culture \u00b6 Kaizen-85 is the name of the AI aboard the leisure space ship Nautilus in the game Event 0 .

[17] [18] There are normally a series of causes stemming from one root cause, [19] and they can be visualized using fishbone diagrams or tables. The Five Whys can be used as a foundational tool in personal improvement, [20] or as a means to create wealth. [21] Masaaki Imai made the term famous in his book Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success . [1] In the Toyota Way Fieldbook , Liker and Meier discuss the kaizen blitz and kaizen burst (or kaizen event) approaches to continuous improvement. A kaizen blitz, or rapid improvement, is a focused activity on a particular process or activity. The basic concept is to identify and quickly remove waste. Another approach is that of the kaizen burst, a specific kaizen activity on a particular process in the value stream . [22] Kaizen facilitators generally[ weasel words ] go through training and certification before attempting a Kaizen project.[ citation needed ] In the 1990s, Professor Iwao Kobayashi published his book 20 Keys to Workplace Improvement and created a practical, step-by-step improvement framework called \"the 20 Keys\". He identified 20 operations focus areas which should be improved to attain holistic and sustainable change. He went further and identified the 5 levels of implementation for each of these 20 focus areas. 4 of the focus areas are called Foundation Keys. According to the 20 Keys, these foundation keys should be launched ahead of the others in order to form a strong constitution in the company. The four foundation keys are: Key 1 \u2013 Cleaning and Organizing to Make Work Easy, which is based on the 5S methodology. Key 2 \u2013 Goal Alignment/Rationalizing the System Key 3 \u2013 Small Group Activities Key 4 \u2013 Leading and Site Technology","title":"Implementation"},{"location":"webclips/Kaizen%20-%20Wikipedia/#in-popular-culture","text":"Kaizen-85 is the name of the AI aboard the leisure space ship Nautilus in the game Event 0 .","title":"In popular culture"},{"location":"webclips/Kaizen%20-%20Wikipedia/#see-also","text":"(Clipped, please see #source Kaizen - Wikipedia )","title":"See also"},{"location":"webclips/Kaizen%20-%20Wikipedia/#-","text":"Business process re-engineering Experiential learning Hansei Kaikaku Kanban , Kanban Method Management fad Mottainai , a sense of regret concerning waste Muda (Japanese term) Overall equipment effectiveness Quality circle Six Sigma Statistical process control Theory of constraints Total productive maintenance TRIZ , the theory of inventive problem solving Visual control","title":"---"},{"location":"webclips/Kaizen%20-%20Wikipedia/#referencesedit","text":"","title":"References[edit]"},{"location":"webclips/Kaizen%20-%20Wikipedia/#notesedit","text":"^ Jump up to: a b Imai, Masaaki (1986).

OData helps you focus on your business logic while building RESTful APIs without having to worry about the approaches to define request and response headers, status codes, HTTP methods, URL conventions, media types, payload formats and query options etc. OData also guides you about tracking changes, defining functions/actions for reusable procedures and sending asynchronous/batch requests etc. Additionally, OData provides facility for extension to fulfil any custom needs of your RESTful APIs. OData RESTful APIs are easy to consume. The OData metadata, a machine-readable description of the data model of the APIs, enables the creation of powerful generic client proxies and tools. Some of them can help you interact with OData even without knowing anything about the protocol. The following 6 steps demonstrate 6 interesting scenarios of OData consumption across different programming platforms. But if you are a non-developer and would like to simply play with OData, XOData is the best start for you. Step 1: Requesting resources \u00b6 As the REST principles go, \"Everything is a Resource\". As a simple start, let's see how resources can be retrieved from the OData RESTful APIs. The sample service used is the TripPin service which simulates the service of an open trip management system. Our friend, Russell Whyte, who has formerly registered TripPin, would like to find out who are the other people in it. HTTP request C# Olingo JavaScript client C++ Node.js Contribute GET https://services.odata.org/v4/TripPinServiceRW/People HTTP/1.1 OData-Version: 4.0 OData-MaxVersion: 4.0 var context = new DefaultContainer(new Uri(\"https://services.odata.org/v4/TripPinServiceRW/\")); var people = context.People.Execute(); The client library used is the OData v4 Client Code Generator . Typed syntax var client = new ODataClient(\"https://services.odata.org/v4/TripPinServiceRW/\"); var people = await client.For<People>().FindEntriesAsync(); Dynamic syntax var x = ODataDynamic.Expression; var client = new ODataClient(\"https://services.odata.org/v4/TripPinServiceRW/\"); var people = await client.For(x.People).FindEntriesAsync(); The client library used is the Simple.OData.Client . The code is contributed by Vagif Abilov var serviceRoot = 'https://services.odata.org/V4/TripPinServiceRW/'; var headers = { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', Accept: 'application/json' }; var request = { requestUri: serviceRoot + 'People', method: 'GET', headers: headers, data: null }; odatajs.oData.request( request, function (data, response) { var people = data.value; }, function (err) { alert('Fail: ' + err.Message); } ); The client library used is the Olingo OData Client for JavaScript . auto service_context = std::make_shared<DefaultContainer>(U(\"https://services.odata.org/V4/(S(34wtn2c0hkuk5ekg0pjr513b))/TripPinServiceRW/\")); auto people = service_context->create_people_query()->execute_query().get(); The client library used is the ODataCpp Client . The code is contributed by Bin Xu. var http = require('http'); var serviceRoot = 'https://services.odata.org/v4/TripPinServiceRW/'; getURL(serviceRoot + 'People'); function getURL(url) { var body = ''; http.get(url, function (response) { response.on('data', function (chunk) { body+=chunk; }); response.on('end', function () { console.log(body); }); }).on('error', function(e) { console.log('ERROR: ' + e.message); }); } Download and install the Node.js platform from nodejs.org then run the snippets below using the node command. The code is contributed by Mark Peterson Contribute to \"Understanding OData in 6 steps\" \u00b6 Want to contribute code snippet for another platform or suggest changes to this content? You can edit and submit changes to \"Understanding OData in 6 steps\" on its Github repository . Step 2: Requesting an individual resource \u00b6 REST principles also say, that every resource is identified by a unique identifier. OData also enables defining key properties of a resource and retrieving it using the keys. In this step, Russell wants to find the information about himself by specifying his username as the key. HTTP request C# Olingo JavaScript client C++ Node.js Contribute GET https://services.odata.org/v4/TripPinServiceRW/People('russellwhyte') HTTP/1.1 OData-Version: 4.0 OData-MaxVersion: 4.0 var context = new DefaultContainer(new Uri(\"https://services.odata.org/v4/(S(34wtn2c0hkuk5ekg0pjr513b))/TripPinServiceRW/\")); var person = context.People.ByKey(userName: \"russellwhyte\").GetValue(); The client library used is the OData v4 Client Code Generator .

You can edit and submit changes to \"Understanding OData in 6 steps\" on its Github repository . Step 3: Queries \u00b6 As an architecture that's built on top of the current features of the Web, RESTful APIs can also support query strings. For that, OData defines a series of system query options that can help you construct complicated queries for the resources you want. With the help of that, our friend Russell can find out the first 2 persons in the system who have registered at least one trip that costs more than 3000, and only display their first name and last name. HTTP request C# Olingo JavaScript client C++ Node.js Contribute GET https://services.odata.org/v4/TripPinServiceRW/People?$top=2 &amp; $select=FirstName, LastName &amp; $filter=Trips/any(d:d/Budget gt 3000) HTTP/1.1 OData-Version: 4.0 OData-MaxVersion: 4.0 var context = new DefaultContainer(new Uri(\"https://services.odata.org/v4/(S(34wtn2c0hkuk5ekg0pjr513b))/TripPinServiceRW/\")); var people = context.People.Where(c => c.Trips.Any(d => d.Budget > 3000)).Take(2).Select(c => new {c.FirstName, c.LastName}); The client library used is the OData v4 Client Code Generator .

You can edit and submit changes to \"Understanding OData in 6 steps\" on its Github repository . Step 4: Creating a new resource \u00b6 REST principles require the using of simple and uniform interfaces. With that regard, OData clients can expect unified interfaces of the resources. The stateless transfer of representations in REST are carried out by using different HTTP methods in the requests. After having gone through the first 3 steps, Russell thinks the system is useful. He wants to add his best friend Lewis to the system. He finds out that all he needs to do is to send a POST request containing a JSON representation of Lewis' information to the same interface from which he requested the people information.

You can edit and submit changes to \"Understanding OData in 6 steps\" on its Github repository . Step 5: Relating resources \u00b6 In RESTful APIs, resources are usually dependent with each other. For that, the concept of relationships in OData can be defined among resources to add flexibility and richness to the data model. For example, in the TripPin OData service, people are related to the trips that they've booked using the system. Knowing that, Russell would like to invite Lewis to his existing trip in the U.S. by relating that trip to Lewis.

You can edit and submit changes to \"Understanding OData in 6 steps\" on its Github repository . Step 6: Invoking a function \u00b6 In RESTful APIs, there can be some custom operations that contain complicated logic and can be frequently used. For that purpose, OData supports defining functions and actions to represent such operations. They are also resources themselves and can be bound to existing resources. After having explored the TripPin OData service, Russell finds out that the it has a function called GetInvolvedPeople from which he can find out the involved people of a specific trip. He invokes the function to find out who else other than him and Lewis goes to that trip in the U.S. HTTP request C# Olingo JavaScript client C++ Node.js Contribute GET https://services.odata.org/v4/(S(34wtn2c0hkuk5ekg0pjr513b))/TripPinServiceRW/People('russellwhyte')/Trips(0)/Microsoft.OData.SampleService.Models.TripPin.GetInvolvedPeople() HTTP/1.1 OData-Version: 4.0 OData-MaxVersion: 4.0 var context = new DefaultContainer(new Uri(\"https://services.odata.org/v4/(S(34wtn2c0hkuk5ekg0pjr513b))/TripPinServiceRW/\")); var trip = context.People.ByKey(userName: \"russellwhyte\").Trips.ByKey(tripId: 0).GetValue(); var people = trip.GetInvolvedPeople().Execute(); The client library used is the OData v4 Client Code Generator .
