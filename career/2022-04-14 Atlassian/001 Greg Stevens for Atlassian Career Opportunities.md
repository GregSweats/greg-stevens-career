## Why Me and You? (`Greg + Atlassian ~= 💘`)

- I was going to start a service to streamline web development agencies utilizing Atlassian Jira, Customer Service Management, and Work Management.
- Have ran that with three agencies, firstly my previous agency, then my new business, Dalyle DevOps Inc.
	- I would LOVE to help change that, make the world love Bitbucket more, it's really great, and truly amazing when tied into the entire Atlassian ecosystem.
- I am a fan, but also know why I am using GitHub instead of Bitbucket ;) 
	- 
- SaaS, PaaS, provided for 17+ years.
- Competitive nature drives me. Learning fuels me. Seeing a change someone made to my code, or watching someone do something because of what we discussed, what I taught/showed them, ... is enthralling.
- I can probably give you a tip a day for at least a year on keyboard shortcuts alone.
- Dale Carnegie course at 16 years old taught me how to speak in public, and gave me opportunities to hone that skill.
- Being a [JDRF](https://www.jdrf.ca) Ambassador from 16-24 years old gave me several public speaking opportunities to share my diabetes story amongst hundreds of people (~500 max I believe).
	- Not just people, but prominent Calgary business people, people who can afford a rather expensive dinner at a beautiful gala.
