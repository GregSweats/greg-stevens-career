# 201 - Rambling

>  (just started typing... ðŸ’©âŒ¨)

- Remember the battle between Markdown and ReTex
  (or whatever it was called)...I picked Markdown,
  GitHub picked Markdown, Notion picked Markdown, yay!
    - Basically, I'm a Markdown Hipster, I was in it before it was cool.
- Working on a term... "Holistic Website/Web App Dev & Hosting"
    - Would say "Holistic Web DevOps" or "Holistic WebDevOps"?
    - What do you think?
    - Covers all aspects of a Website/Web App Lifecycle,
      many of which are ignored or not known about at many
      Calgary and Canadian wide agencies. I've been researching
      for several years, while in my role as IT Director at a 
      boutique, full-service Web Agency in Calgary, working
      mainly with Public Sector Oil & Gas Companies for 
      the past 17 years.
- Life Purpose as of ~July 2021
   - "Make the Web Industry Better!"
   - For clients, workers, site visitors, app users, etc.
   - Do this by embracing the DevOps philosphy/mindset,
     and being Agile, a pre-req in my mind for DevOps,
     one I'm AMAZED is not even understood in Orgs
     claiming to be agile.
   - I made a presentation, registered domains, and
    started raising interest amongst my surprisingly 
    vast network of contacts.
      - I was a MeetUp junkie.
      - CAMUG, ATB Events, Benevity, Solium (now ???),
      - Agile, Developer, Testing, Entrepreneur, Startup,
        Funding, Speed Dating, 
     - Hosted table at HackerX Interviews
        - Speed Dating style Interviews
        - WomanHack event
        - Lot of fresh-out-of-school Data Scientists
          & Full-Stack Developers.
       - Many FS Devs from SAIT's fast-track course.
         I met the administrator of the course and 
         have been able to connect with new talent
         out of it. SAIT trains them on the basics of:
         git, GitHub, npm, and React (rather than Vue).
      - Would like to be able to influence the program a bit, 
         hopefully with/through partnerships with Amazon
         and SAIT/all Educational institutes (High Schools too!).
         - I have a soon-to-be published Open Source
           package for connecting `Microsoft Power BI`
           to a Student's Moodle site, using Moodle's
           built-in Mobile Rest API, and an auth token
           from the Moodle Account Settings page.
         - Documented and committed with Conventional Commits.
           in a way meant to be walked through as a lab in
           Grades 7+ (Jr. High)

     - Hundreds of wonderful people from powerlifting events & the gym.
