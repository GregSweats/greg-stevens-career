# README

Actual README is found in the Obsidian Vault at [`./obsvault/README.md`](./obsvault/README.md).

## Git Commits
Main reason for this repo is to give an idea of how my git flow and commits are for potential employers, clients, teammates, colleagues, etc.

Please see the commits and look at the nice Conventional Commits standards being followed.
Not just nice, but easy to enforce/help with IDE plugins, so it takes less time than writing a [poor git message](https://xkcd.com/1296/).
