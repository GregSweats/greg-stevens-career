> **Apache Airflow** is an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software "Open-source software") [workflow management platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow_management_system "Workflow management system") for data engineering pipelines. It started at [Airbnb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb "Airbnb") in October 2014[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Airflow#cite_note-2) as a solution to manage the company's increasingly complex workflows. Creating Airflow allowed Airbnb to programmatically author and schedule their workflows and monitor them via the built-in Airflow [user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface "User interface").[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Airflow#cite_note-3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Airflow#cite_note-4) From the beginning, the project was made open source, becoming an [Apache Incubator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Incubator "Apache Incubator") project in March 2016 and a top-level [Apache Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apache_Software_Foundation "The Apache Software Foundation") project in January 2019.

> Airflow is written in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)"), and workflows are created via Python scripts. Airflow is designed under the principle of "configuration as code". While other "configuration as code" workflow platforms exist using markup languages like [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML"), using Python allows developers to import libraries and classes to help them create their workflows.
