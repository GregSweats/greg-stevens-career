## Books

Read recently, or influenced me enough to add them to my GoodReads.com profile.
- Helps You see what made me, me ðŸ˜‰
- DevOps, Lean, Kanban, Scrum, Six Sigma (just a bit) all from 2018 to 2022 (& beyond ðŸš€)
- GoodReads is easiest/best way I can share what I learn with others, when I am too busy to help 1:1

Orange & Blue Colour Scheme

Blue is my (and my son's) favourite colour! ^ftg2dXQV

Notice, I use "colour" and "favourite"
the Canadian localized spelling.

Yet in code and tech, due to US unofficial-standard globally
I will use "Color" as needed, and swap between the two naturally.

All my writings, typings, messages, consider TOO MUCH about
grammar, spelling, and best-practices for clear communications,
mixed with my 17 years at my last agency, from Jr. Dev to IT Director. ^O2ZdJYpp

Dalyle DevOps Inc.
(My Solo Company, est. Oct. 2021) ^CguhE1jk

(ISO Date Format (YYY-MM-DD) looked gross here
so I used "real" English for the est. date
swap hats between DEV and REAL-PERSON all the time.
+ Change/break rules if result is better.)

Now at dalyle.IO instead of .CA.
Real-world feedback causing me to switch back to @dalyle.ca
+ Nicer for local businesses, clients, friends, family, etc.
+ Easier for people to remember (.io is not spoken commonly yet)

= SUCCESS, PROPSERITY, HAPPINESS 

...for all stakeholders, client's company, client themselves (personal connections, or Agile's people over process belief), Workers (Devs, Architects, Testers, Documenters, Project Managers, etc.).

#aside: Those roles should be shared amongst the team so there is no single person who knows something that another does not. Paired programming, shared knowledge bases (Obsidian.md based git repos), useful meetings or Standups, ...

Green = Success ;) ^xZPye2LK

All done by me, my skills, knowledge, real-world experience.
