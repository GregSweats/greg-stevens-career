Please note, this was created and works with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), the GitHub, Bitbucket, or other Markdown renderer won't work right, yet.

Open the root of this git repo as an Obsidian Vault for the best experience.

Fun starts in the [`career/` folder](README%20-%20Greg%20Stevens%20for%20Atlassian.md) :).

As well as **the only reason this vault exists, the most important piece as of 2022-04-16** -
