> Hugin (Old Norse _Huginn_) comes from the word _hugr_,[9] “thought.” Munin (Old Norse _Muninn*_) comes from the word _munr_,[10] which is more difficult to translate, but can encompass the concepts of “thought,” “desire,” and “emotion.” (The two ravens’ names are often translated as “Thought” and “Memory” in popular works on Norse mythology, and “Thought” is quite accurate, but “Memory” is at best imprecise and rather arbitrary.) The two names therefore can’t be neatly distinguished from one another; they overlap to the point of being virtually synonymous.[11] This reflects the fact that, in the sources, Hugin and Munin don’t have distinct personalities.
They’re a duplicate form of the same underlying idea.
