### Purely functional programming - Wikipedia
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming

> In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), **purely functional programming** usually designates a [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm "Programming paradigm")—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats all [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation "Computation") as the evaluation of [mathematical functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)").
> 
> [Program state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_state "Program state") and [mutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutable "Mutable") objects are usually modeled with [temporal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_logic "Temporal logic"), as explicit variables that represent the program state at each step of a program execution: a variable state is passed as an [input parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_parameter "Input parameter") of a state-transforming function, which returns the updated state as part of its return value. This style handles state changes without losing the [referential transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency "Referential transparency") of the program expressions.
> 
> Purely functional programming consists of ensuring that functions, inside the [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming "Functional programming") paradigm, will only depend on their arguments, regardless of any global or local state. A pure functional subroutine only has visibility of changes of state represented by state variables included in its scope.

### Lookout Engineering Reviews - Glassdoor

> Pros
> 
> \- My direct management is great to work with. Weekly 1:1s means nothing has time to go seriously wrong, and you always get a chance at addressing issues fast. Suggestions are honestly considered and acted on - Office perks are great. Working from home is not frowned upon, and allows for good life-work balance - As the company is a start-up trying to evolve into an enterprise, there's a lot of disorganization flying around, which means opportunities really. If you are a business-savvy and experienced engineer, you can make sense of the messy parts and be part of the solution - A lot of the grief people have about working at lookout comes from the way ops are done at the company. As part of the team responsible for correcting this, finding a purpose in your work is easy. - My recruitment process was very fast, respectful of my time and surprisingly pleasant. Instead of doing a computer-led coding assignment, I got to have a live coding session with my future team lead, and had the opportunity to get to know him better, his coding philosophy, and explain the rationale behind the code I was writing. Also, this being a live coding interview, you feel comforted by the fact that you won't go astray, or be grossly missing the automated unit testing's logic at the end of the assignment - In my team, employee growth is valued by management. No idea how it goes in other teams - The product is exciting, socially valuable and in a high-growth niche
> 
> Cons
> 
> \- Some people build up resentment and sway around negativity - The company, being a start-up, sometimes has trouble getting itself together and focusing on value-generating activities. This can be disorienting and sometimes disheartening - I would not recommend junior or school-fresh engineers to start their careers at Lookout, as it currently is not providing the kind of structure and organizational best practices you'd hope to acquire being green in this industry - Lack of documentation about company-specific implementations can be confusing - The company's tried to steer the ship many times in the past, and that can be seen through an incoherent tech stack with way too many patterns and frameworks being used. In a way, it is symptomatic of a start-up not yet being able to transition from "small team of talented engineers who do something really good" to a well-oiled machine - Lack of leadership by parts of management AND technical positions. - People generally lack non-technical skills that are necessary even in a tech-focused business - You have flexibility of working hours, which can lead to you not being ever totally "off" unless you discipline yourself
> 
> Advice to Management
> 
> If your middle management is not demonstrating leadership and can't achieve your vision, it's time to think either train middle management in business skills, or reshuffle positions so that your management can act on your business vision

### Lookout Engineering Reviews - Glassdoor
URL: https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Lookout-Engineering-Reviews-EI_IE318794.0,7_KO8,19.htm

> Pros
> 
> During my time in this company I have learned and met good people. It has been an interesting ride.
> 
> Cons
> 
> \* death marches \* middle managers that have turned the gaslighting of their employees into a competitive sport \* teams that treat other teams like their enemy \* teams that actively sabotage other teams \* new good people sidelined in favor of old employees who have the ear of management \* focus on security theater while great security researchers are stuck in molasses trying to do their freaking job!! \* a perverse fixation on doubling down and adding to technical debt \* engineering practices and culture is a mighty trash fire on which engineering management and "senior" architects sacrifice the sanity and happiness of new engineers (attrition on some teams is 50%+!!!) \* executive management that talks about cutting costs "saving every pencil" while the company burns money constantly recreating existing software projects and redoing work of other teams
> 
> Advice to Management
> 
> If you care about this company and the its future you need to understand that you are in the business of building software! You have been doing the "new path" for 3 years but you are not anywhere in terms of building a product. While your c-level is saving pencils the new middle management is running the ship. Running it right into the bottom of the ocean. They are ruining the engineering organization. Fire your engineering management and "senior" architects. Fire your old pre-2015 product team.. Roll up your sleeves and start building software again!! Stop lying to yourselves that everything is ok.

### BRE/ERE Regular Expressions - GNU GREP and RIPGREP
URL: https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_gnugrep_ripgrep/breere-regular-expressions.html

> ## [BRE/ERE Regular Expressions](https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_gnugrep_ripgrep/breere-regular-expressions.html#breere-regular-expressions)
> 
> This chapter will cover Basic and Extended Regular Expressions as implemented in `GNU grep`. Though not strictly conforming to [POSIX specifications](https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_gnugrep_ripgrep/%5Bhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.%5D(https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.)html), most of it is applicable to other `grep` implementations as well. Unless otherwise indicated, examples and descriptions will assume ASCII input. `GNU grep` also supports Perl Compatible Regular Expressions, which will be covered in a later chapter.
> 
> By default, `grep` treats the search pattern as Basic Regular Expression (BRE)
> 
> -   `-G` option can be used to specify explicitly that BRE is needed
> -   `-E` option will enable Extended Regular Expression (ERE)
>     -   in `GNU grep`, BRE and ERE only differ in how metacharacters are specified, no difference in features
> -   `-F` option will cause the search patterns to be treated literally
> -   `-P` if available, this option will enable Perl Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE)
> 
> > ![info](https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_gnugrep_ripgrep/images/info.svg) Files used in examples are available chapter wise from [learn\_gnugrep\_ripgrep repo](https://github.com/learnbyexample/learn_gnugrep_ripgrep/tree/master/example_files). The directory for this chapter is `bre_ere`.

### Metabase quest (Metabase vs X "competitor") - FAQ - Metabase Discussion
URL: https://discourse.metabase.com/t/metabase-quest-metabase-vs-x-competitor/4445/3

> Building on the cost perspective. Tableau needs a much bigger server than Metabase to run well. It’s difficult to do much for less than £2000 per year in licensing.  
> PowerBI looks great at first (£8 per user per month), but once you start to do anything clever it very quickly switches to the hosted model at £XXXX per month plus user licences. Ignore the free licence unless you’re one person working on their own.
> 
> I don’t do much with Tableau, but I have done a lttle with PowerBI.  
> PowerBI is prettier at the moment and does a very nice job of working with multiple data sources. The data exploration is weak compared to Metabase, though you do get proper drilldown and can select by clicking charts rather than having to use parameters.  
> PowerBI’s greatest weakness is when it comes to sharing your work - you export to PowerPoint to view a picture of your work. Metabase’s option of sharing links is far more powerful.
