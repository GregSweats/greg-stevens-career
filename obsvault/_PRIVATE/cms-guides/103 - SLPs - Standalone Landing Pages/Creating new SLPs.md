# How Hard for PKI IT Team?

- Evan says not hard.
- Copy the SLP.
- Modify
- Melissa's team will provide the creative.


# When is next SLP expected?

## Melissa - current chevron
- Evan says it is updating an existing page, not creating ne ones.


## Dec 1
Next might be December 1
when the fall home heating campaign is finished.



PHP will be a bit new but Sylvain has done PHP, .NET, etc...
- @Melissa: Good news.




Melissa's goal fo SLP is:

Custom takes action, fills out form.


Probability of visitor not taking action is high.	


- @Evan: good question - analytics / stats around current LP
