# 301 Redirects
Most sites, except for Sparlings and perhaps one or two atypical ones, manage their redirects through the Apache `.htaccess` file, in the root of the site.


Other sites may use a C5 plugin to manage redirects, which may be the case of Sparlings, yet others might use something else, such as a separate control panel (5% chance of happening).
