# Insomnia and inso CLI


> [!Download]
> Download for #free from https://insomnia.rest/

## Why?
- I replaced  [[Postman]] with [[Insomnia]] back in 2019.
- Was watching Insomnia wayyyy back when it was `PostWoman`.
- `Kong`, owner #Company, still has Insomnia core #OpenSource 
- `Postman` pricing was somewhat steep for what I needed.
- Felt better with the alternative.
- Have not looked back much, but happy to work with either [[Postman]], [[Insomnia and inso CLI]], or good ol'  [[curl]].
