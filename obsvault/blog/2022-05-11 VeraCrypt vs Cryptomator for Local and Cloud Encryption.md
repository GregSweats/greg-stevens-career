# VeraCrypt vs Cryptomator for Local and Cloud Encryption

## Conclusion
- VeraCrypt for local (set volume sizes, can be grown with built-in tools)
- Cryptomator for cloud (single files are encrypted and uploaded, rather than a whole volume).

### Conclusion Notes
- I have not tried Cryptomator but have, and will continue to use more, Veracrypt for now.
- I would rather not have my file listing potentially enumerable.
- My use is more for local encryption, vault storage, than anything else.
- Curious how Cryptomator would work with a git repo...eww, each .git/* file encrypted?
