## Meetup Groupie
      - I was a MeetUp junkie.
      - CAMUG, ATB Events, Benevity, Solium (now ???),
      - Agile, Developer, Testing, Entrepreneur, Startup,
        Funding, Speed Dating, 
     - Hosted table at HackerX Interviews
        - Speed Dating style Interviews
        - WomanHack event
        - Lot of fresh-out-of-school Data Scientists
          & Full-Stack Developers.
       - Many FS Devs from SAIT's fast-track course.
         I met the administrator of the course and 
         have been able to connect with new talent
         out of it. SAIT trains them on the basics of:
         git, GitHub, npm, and React (rather than Vue).
      - Would like to be able to influence the program a bit, 
         hopefully with/through partnerships with Amazon
         and SAIT/all Educational institutes (High Schools too!).
         - I have a soon-to-be published Open Source
           package for connecting `Microsoft Power BI`
           to a Student's Moodle site, using Moodle's
           built-in Mobile Rest API, and an auth token
           from the Moodle Account Settings page.
         - Documented and committed with Conventional Commits.
           in a way meant to be walked through as a lab in
           Grades 7+ (Jr. High)

     - Hundreds of wonderful people from powerlifting events & the gym.
