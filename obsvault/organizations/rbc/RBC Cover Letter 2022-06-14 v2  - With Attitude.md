## üò±

- This song is why I decided to allow me to be me, and

---

- Just the beat I guess, tired, and there's just so much I could say/write/do.
- About what? Anything really.

---

- You can thank that song for this bite-sized knowledge.
- Checkout anywhere on this site for examples of information overload üåä.

- Right now though, it's about why you should keep reading, dear Reader.
- Be you RBC, Recruiter, HR, or even..**Exec?**
	- *#dreaming, but if it makes it up to your level please [[Contact Greg|let me know]]*.

## Passion for Finance
- I recently submitted an entry for a MS Excel Builder's Challenge put on by www.TillerHQ.com.
- That led to the creation of https://github.com/trxn8r/trxn8r
- Which was really started ~18 months ago when I created [[powerbi-moodle-data-source (Connect Power BI to Moodle)]]
- https://github.com/Savvy-Student-Stats/powerbi-moodle-data-source

## Passion for , Big Data, Highly Reliable Systems

#todo 

- üíó I would love to work with Terabytes, ExabOon  ?N nNnnnytes, Gigabytes, so many bytes sized datasets.
- üö´ Almost love to work with it in ways that feel unacceptable by social norms.
-

## Passion for Agile PM, Great Tools

#todo ?

## ~24 Years of Linux Server Admin Experience
- I'm 35 years old...you can do that math.
- First one was a Linux router for a friend's father's business when I was around 13.
- Then some small businesses hired me for websites and managing their networks, Exchange servers, and replacing file servers with [[Linux Samba]]




## (Weird) Natural Inclination to Data/Text Parsing
- Checkout [[TRXN8R]] again. Lots of text parsing and transformation going on.
- Structured as an [[ETL]] Workflow.
- Original ~~itch I was trying to scratch~~ problem I was trying to solve..
- was actually parsing the EQ Bank data files, or pulling from JSON.
- I find parsing human conversation harder than parsing text.

---

### Application Migration, Data Imports
- Couple dozen intense imports for custom apps and sites at www.MediaDog.ca
- Transforming [[News Release APIs]] content into reliably usable content for public sector websites.
- So much more... ask me, trying to be bite-sized info here.

---

### Thought Everybody Fuzzy Searched
- I can't imagine life without it.
- My [[Daily Workflow]] with [[Obsidian]], [[GitHub]], [[VS Code]], [[Markdown]], [[TickTick#Launcher]] and more...
- led me to believe fuzzy search (googling / autocomplete) was how others thought too.
- üß† that was not the case.

---

- Thinking in fuzzy search has me parsing text naturally.
- Parsing text in my brain, or in code.

---

### Wrote Several Web Scrapers
- Helped migrate web content for our websites at [[Media Dog Productions Inc.|mediadog]]
- Few dozen sites used a few methods for grabbing public company stock price to display on their site.
	- Caching implemented of course üí°.
- Personally used for grabbing financial data.
- Trying still to automate my www.EQBank.ca downloads üêí
	- I have six sub-accounts for various reasons.
	- Guess it's like [[Envelope Budgeting]]?

---

### Data for Agricultural Science

- 10 year update on a 25+ year agricultural study.
- Data in mutliple unstructured Excel sheets in multiple workbooks.
- Collaborated on by 12+ scientists Canada wide.
- Transformed into JSON to load into CMS.
- [Home - Forage U-Pick (beefresearch.ca)](https://upick.beefresearch.ca/)


---

### Other
- WHOIS connector and parser
- Telnet response parses (pre 2014 but still sometimes...[[nc]] is great.

---

## 17+ Years Integrating & Producing APIs
- Producing part is a bit of a stretch as the user base was limited to [[Media Dog Productions Inc.|our websites]]
- not to users that could hit the 10k+ concurrent request threshold.
- Yet on systems that could, in theory, scale to that.
- Little more than theory since [[a2]] and other [[Benchmarking Tools|benchmarking tools]]

---

## Communication Style
- Constantly refining. [[Kaizen]].
- Please let me know any feedback.
- Will be interesting and informational.
- Important in these remote work times.

---

## DevOps Architecture


- 14+ years hosting mainly public sector companies, or business critical applications, with [[Media Dog Productions Inc.]]
- ~6 months as the [[DevOps]] consultant architecting hosting for 24 brands for a multi-billion dollar corporation.

---

## Full-stack Web Dev
- ...before that term ever existed üßì.
- ...before Linux was cool in the industry üòé.
- ...before I had a girlfriend üíã.

---

## Abrupt Ending!?

- Am I making sense?
- There's so much to cover I would just love to chat.
- From DevOps to FS Web Dev to Leadership to Business Intelligence to Highly Available Servers to Virtualization (cloud or on-prem).

## Making of Video
