### What is .NET MAUI? - .NET MAUI | Microsoft Docs
URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui

> In a .NET MAUI app, you write code that primarily interacts with the .NET MAUI API (1). .NET MAUI then directly consumes the native platform APIs (3). In addition, app code may directly exercise platform APIs (2), if required.
> 
> .NET MAUI apps can be written on PC or Mac, and compile into native app packages:
> 
> -   Android apps built using .NET MAUI compile from C# into intermediate language (IL) which is then just-in-time (JIT) compiled to a native assembly when the app launches.
> -   iOS apps built using .NET MAUI are fully ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled from C# into native ARM assembly code.
> -   macOS apps built using .NET MAUI use Mac Catalyst, a solution from Apple that brings your iOS app built with UIKit to the desktop, and augments it with additional AppKit and platform APIs as required.
> -   Windows apps built using .NET MAUI use Windows UI 3 (WinUI 3) library to create native apps that target the Windows desktop. For more information about WinUI 3, see [Windows UI Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/).

> ## The MicroPython REPL
> 
> The last section detailed the installation of MicroPython on an ESP8266-based microcontroller using Python and a package called **esptool**. In this section, you will learn how to write commands to the MicroPython REPL (the Micropython prompt) to turn an LED on and off.
> 
> Before you can use the MicroPython REPL (the MicroPython prompt) running on a microcontroller, MicroPython needs to be installed on the board. A serial communication tool, like PuTTY, also needs to be installed on your computer to communicate with the microcontroller over a serial line. The previous section detailed how to install MicroPython on an ESP8266-based microcontroller and how to install [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) on Windows.

URL: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/code-loading/#Environments-1

> ## [Environments](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/code-loading/#Environments)[](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/code-loading/#Environments "Permalink")
> 
> An *environment* determines what `import X` and `using X` mean in various code contexts and what files these statements cause to be loaded. Julia understands two kinds of environments:
> 
> 1.  **A project environment** is a directory with a project file and an optional manifest file, and forms an *explicit environment*. The project file determines what the names and identities of the direct dependencies of a project are. The manifest file, if present, gives a complete dependency graph, including all direct and indirect dependencies, exact versions of each dependency, and sufficient information to locate and load the correct version.
> 2.  **A package directory** is a directory containing the source trees of a set of packages as subdirectories, and forms an *implicit environment*. If `X` is a subdirectory of a package directory and `X/src/X.jl` exists, then the package `X` is available in the package directory environment and `X/src/X.jl` is the source file by which it is loaded.
> 
> These can be intermixed to create **a stacked environment**: an ordered set of project environments and package directories, overlaid to make a single composite environment. The precedence and visibility rules then combine to determine which packages are available and where they get loaded from. Julia's load path forms a stacked environment, for example.
> 
> These environment each serve a different purpose:

### OfficeDev/script-lab: Create, run and share your code directly from Office
URL: https://github.com/OfficeDev/script-lab

> ## What is Script Lab?
> 
> Wouldn't it be crazy if you could launch Excel, click to open a small code window, and then instantly start writing and executing JavaScript that interacts with your spreadsheet?
> 
> Script lab is a tool for anyone who wants to learn about writing Office Add-ins for Excel, Outlook, Word, or PowerPoint. The focus is the Office JavaScript API, which is the technology you need for building Office Add-ins that run across platforms. Maybe you're an experienced Office developer and you want to quickly prototype a feature for your add-in. Or maybe you've never tried writing code for Office and you just want to play with a sample and tweak it to learn more. Either way, Script Lab is for you.
> 
> Script Lab has three main features:
> 
> -   **Code** in a pane beside your spreadsheet. IntelliSense is there while you type so you can easily discover and use the Office JavaScript objects and methods. And if you don't want to start from scratch there are plenty of samples pre-installed with Script Lab. Your snippets can use any TypeScript features like arrow functions, template strings, and async/await (i.e., a good chunk of ES6 and ES7 features). But it's not only script: your snippets can also use HTML, CSS, and references to external libraries and data on the web. Script Lab uses the Monaco editor, the same tech that powers VS Code, so it's beautiful and lightweight.
> -   **Run** the code in another pane beside the editor. Execution can include logic, API calls to Office, UI in the pane, and even output to a console. Every time you make a code change you can refresh the editor and run the new version in seconds.
> -   **Share** your snippets through GitHub. If you create a snippet you'd like to share, you can use Script Lab to save it. Then send the link to someone else to try it and tweak it on their computer. The Import feature lets you load other people's snippets.
> 
> Script Lab works in Office 2013 or later on Windows, Office on the web, or Office on Mac.
> 
> You can get [Script Lab](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104380862) right now for free from Microsoft AppSource! It works for Excel, Word, and PowerPoint.
> 
> If you're interested in developing for Outlook, you can get [Script Lab for Outlook](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA200001603), also free from AppSource.
> 
> Script Lab is a Microsoft Garage project that began at a hackathon. You can read the story of the original Script Lab creation on the [Garage website](https://www.microsoft.com/garage/profiles/script-lab/).

> I have automated release processes for many of my clients in the past and got tired of reinventing automated semver versioning over and over again, so I decided to write a cross-platform tool for it. I couldn't find any alternative which is built for pipeline usage.
> 
> Let me know what you think! Hopeful that this tool will grow and be useful to others. There are definitely improvement points, we're only at version 0.2.0 at the time of posting.

### Follow SemVer · Issue #2888 · jashkenas/backbone
URL: https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/2888

> Thanks, but strictly following "semantic" versioning wouldn't work out very well for Backbone. Given that the project is almost all surface area, and very little internals, almost any given change (patch, pull request) to Backbone breaks backwards-compatibility in some small way ... even if only for the folks relying on previously undefined behavior.
> 
> If we strictly followed "semantic" versioning, it would probably be **Backbone.js 43.0.0** by now — which doesn't help anyone evaluate the actual progress of the project.
> 
> So, as I like to joke — not "semantic" versioning, *romantic versioning*.
> 
> > Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
> > 
> > MAJOR version when you make a major new release, or significantly update and/or stabilize the API.  
> > MINOR version when you add minor new features.  
> > PATCH version when you make tiny changes, likely to go unnoticed by most.
> 
> This allows folks, immediately upon hearing about a new release, to get a rough sense of its scope. As to backwards compatibility — ideally *every* release, even major ones, are backwards-compatible. And when they can't be, because an API is changing, it should be done in a way that isn't too difficult to upgrade.
> 
> But avoiding any change to the API, and waiting for a "MAJOR" release to be ready would be a terrific impediment to progress. And the alternative of frequently incrementing the MAJOR version number is incredibly unhelpful.
> 
> Honestly, I'd prefer a simpler scheme that just used `BIG.SMALL` version numbers — like most desktop applications do ... but I'd worry about it breaking package managers and other tooling.

> +1 for spadgos@ question. Version numbers are arbitrary. For some reason, we have agile web apps trying to keep within the same ranges as OSes. Many apps freak out about going past 10...but most of the projects you're modeling off of (Windows, Linux, etc) have 1 year/multi-year dev cycles before release, so 1.x -> 2.x is a big deal. An agile project moves very quickly, incrementing quickly makes sense too.

This visioning method suits its self well for rolling release and where multiple versions of a page will not be installed. This is also good when the "major", "minor" and "patch" version numbers don't make sense in your release cycle.

### Allow projects to use CalVer or SemVer - Technical Steering Committee - Hyperledger Foundation
URL: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/TSC/Allow+projects+to+use+CalVer+or+SemVer

> ## Overview of Proposal
> 
> Allow projects to switch from [SemVer](http://semver.org/) (Semantic Versioning) for their versioning to [CalVer](http://calver.org/) (Calender Versioning) for their versioning.
> 
> Besu is different from a lot of the Hyperledger project in that it is beholden to a standard (Ethereum Mainnet compatibility) that it does not control. While it participates in co-ordination of that standard Besu does not have simple control over it like the other DLT projects do.
> 
> When working with public networks such as Mainnet there is a critical need to use the most current version of Besu, no matter what the semantic compatibility is.  Not dealing with a breaking change is the same as dropping the service.  Mainnet is fairly good about maintaining backwards compatibility, but there are other smaller changes such as P2P network protocol upgrades and RPC APIs that update at an infrequent cadence.
> 
> Besu feels  that a CalVer versioning for the main DLT release itself would better signal how aligned we are to the continually moving target of mainnet compatibility. We think it will also more clearly communicate multiple release streams should not be expected.

> -   Article
> -   02/16/2022
> -   3 minutes to read
> 
> ***Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013*
> 
> **Summary:** Use the procedures in this article to simplify the URL that your organization users to access OWA in Exchange 2013.
> 
> You can simplify the Microsoft Outlook Web App URL that users use to access their Exchange Server 2013 mailbox.
> 
> To simplify access to Outlook Web App for your users, you may want to configure the Outlook Web App Web page, which is usually the default website in IIS, to automatically redirect users to https. The procedure in the "Use IIS Manager to simplify the Outlook Web App URL and force redirection to SSL" section redirects a request for http://*server* to https://*server*/owa. To help secure the information that's sent between the client and the server, the default Web site is set to require Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) at installation.
> 
> When you configure redirection from a top-level directory in Windows Server 2008, the settings are propagated to lower-level directories. For example, when you configure redirection on the default website to the /owa virtual directory, the settings that you configure also appear on the HTTP Redirect page of all the virtual directories, such as /Autodiscover, /Exchange, and /Public. Therefore, you must remove redirection from all the virtual directories except the one that you want redirected.
