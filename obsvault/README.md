# README

This README *(homepage, index, home, etc.)* is for the git repo! For those browsing through:

Please note, this was created and works with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), the GitHub, Bitbucket, or other Markdown renderer won't work right, yet.

Open the root of this git repo as an Obsidian Vault for the best experience.

Fun starts in the [`career/` folder](README%20-%20Greg%20Stevens%20for%20Atlassian.md) :).

As well as **the only reason this vault exists, the most important piece as of 2022-04-16** -
[[README - Greg Stevens for Atlassian|my plead to work with Atlassian üôè]]

All the best,

Greg üò±

### Associated Insomnia HTTP Testing Repo
I use [[Insomnia HTTP Testing]] to store collections of requests for a site.
It is easy enough for a [[Project Manager]] or [[Content Editor]] to create tests,
yet powerful enough to be ran as a part of a [[DevOps Pipeline]].
