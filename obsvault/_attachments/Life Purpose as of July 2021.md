## Life Purpose as of ~July 2021
   - "Make the Web Industry Better!"
   - For clients, workers, site visitors, app users, etc.
   - Do this by embracing the DevOps philosphy/mindset,
     and being Agile, a pre-req in my mind for DevOps,
     one I'm AMAZED is not even understood in Orgs
     claiming to be agile.
   - I made a presentation, registered domains, and
    started raising interest amongst my surprisingly 
    vast network of contacts.
