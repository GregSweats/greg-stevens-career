> "Using the Moodle web service, we extract Course and Grade info to feed into Power BI for pretty reports and AI insights!"

- Made the project public so you, **Atlassian**, could see it. (*2022-04-14*) #new2022 
- Just now starting to Open Source it, so the name/URL/content is subject to change.
- After many revisions, ended up finding out about, and using, the built-in Moodle Mobile REST API to get the data I wanted, then put them into PowerBI tables.
- *Moved project to its own org for future Org changes, maybe someone else takes it over. All the backlinks, yuck. *~~https://github.com/gsteve3/school-stats-powerbi~~
- Wanted to Analyze my Son's grades during COVID Virtual School.
- More in the README.
- First time with either `PowerBI` or `Moodle`, except for brief touches.
	- I have actually integrated websites with a few Learning Management Systems (LMS) over the years
	- One older LMS in particular required some pretty gross #JavaScript hacking.
