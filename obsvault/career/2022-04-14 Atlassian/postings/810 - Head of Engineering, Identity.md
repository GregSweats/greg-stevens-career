> Atlassian’s Identity organisation is seeking a **self-motivated** and **experienced leader** of leaders


- *I have been a leader, both in my work, personal, gym, volunteer life, and more, it just sort of happens. I would like to be a leader of leaders! Sadly, I think I can, despite a fear of success, with help, mentorship, or just throw me in and I will adapt.*

>looking to **solve large scale problems** and **deliver the next wave of authentication and authorisation platform innovation** that will be l**everaged by Atlassian’s growing suite of cloud products**.

- Exciting! I truly believe in Atlassian's products, and right now Auth is pretty decent, but still could be better, such as improving the popup that comes up when running `git push` with an `https://bitbucket.,..` on a computer you haven't pushed to Bitbucket for in a while. Feels like a CLI, such as  GitHub's `gh` tool has, would be better.
- Few, semi-strong, ideas on the VS Code plugin too, as a poweruser who just couldn't bare with parts of it, including a part where it hard coded a path into the config that threw conflicts every time VS Code synced.
- Just little things, other people wouldn't notice, or realize could be done better, I can bring that to Atlassian.
- Be happy to help contribute in any way to the ever-improving, and quickly improving (last 3 years or so, with COVID, really noticed you stepped it up with Service Desk, StatusPage (previously), and more!)

The [[Identity platform]] plays the critical role of providing fundamental building blocks upon which all Atlassian products are run.

Whether that be for our **heavily used existing products (e.g. Jira), acquisitions or new internally / externally built products.**

Identity also has the important responsibility of navigating the need for **seamless collaboration amongst people, teams and organizations** whilst also **keeping our customers secure as they collaborate**.
**Helping our customers to best navigate that tension is at the heart of Identity’s mission.**

- Such an important thing, and the tension is real, how do we keep data safe in the cloud?
- For me, I use Obsidian right now, and markdown files on my computer, within VeraCrypt encrypted drive files.
- Then I use Obsidian Sync to keep it between devices, I trust sync more than I trust my data living on someone else's cloud.
- With my exit from my 17+ year agency, it left a gap in someone capable to handle the Hosting business, which I am still maintaining due to that difficulty.
	- Keeping customers data secure, and owned by them, possibly with their own S3 buckets even that hold the data in a way they can see it, such as markdown/yaml files, or something.
	- I have many ideas.
	- I have seen the true hear breaking levels of stress caused  when security fails, or data isn't owned by the customer. I have felt that affect all too well,
	- I have been victim to ransomware myself, but am now more secure than ever.

The ideal candidate is an effective communicator that has experience influencing senior decision-makers across both engineering, product management and design faculties. They are skilled influencers with excellent communication skills and deep technical knowledge in designing, building and operating large scale distributed systems. They can influence without authority, are self-motivated, love working through ambiguity, move rapidly from idea to execution and continuously iterate. Experience complex navigating buy vs build scenarios is also highly regarded.
