# 101 - Greg Soft Skills
---

## Soft Skills

- Goal Oriented > Tasks
	- Project Mission Statements
	- Close contact/communication with Client's actual working team *(not just the PMs or Business Owners, who sometimes are out of date with current working environment)*
- Leadership built-in (raised to be a champ)
- *Friendly* Competitive Nature!
	- Friendly though.
	- Refined through 10+ years at gym 5-10 times per week (I did multiple workouts some days, strength training in the morning (Bench, Squat, Deadlift, + Accessories, mostly Conjugate/Westside style), fitness class at lunch (MMA, Zumba, Yoga, CrossFit, ...) or Olympic lifting training, and then MMA at night, sometimes Zumba)
- Multi-Project and Multi-Client Oriented
	- Manage 5-10 projects (usually ~5-7) daily > 10 years
	- Help entire team (company) support our 100+ sites and clients.
	- [www.mediadog.ca](https://www.mediadog.ca)
		- All Portfolio Sites involved me, somehow, possibly just for launch, but 80% far more than that.
- Project Management
	- Agile
		*I am not stuck on Scrum vs Kanban vs Hybrid, bigger philosophy/lifestyle/mindset of Agile.*
